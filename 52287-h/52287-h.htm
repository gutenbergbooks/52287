<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>About Money.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was in a little log cabin with a dirt floor and
a stick chimney which occupied almost the
whole of one side of it, situated a few miles
from Pond Post Office, a small hamlet located
somewhere in the wilds of Missouri, that the
opening scene of this story took place. There
were four occupants of the cabin, sitting around
in various attitudes, and they all seemed to be
looking at a fifth person, Jonas Keeler by name,
who was standing in the middle of the floor with
a whip in his hand and a fierce frown on his face.
Something was evidently troubling this man
Jonas, and, if we listen to a few scraps of the
conversation that passed between him and his
wife, perhaps we can ascertain what it was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>“And is there any thing else that you
want?” inquired Jonas, in a tone that was fully
as fierce as his frown. “It beats the world how
many things I have to get when I go to town. It
is coffee here, and flour there, until I have to have
a memory as long as this whip-stock for fear that
I will forget some of them.”</p>

<p>“But, father, we have got to live somehow,”
said his wife, who was seated on a rickety chair.
“We can’t grow fat on air.”</p>

<p>“To be sure you can’t, but it seems to me
that you might make things last longer. We
wasn’t in this fix before the war. Then we had
a house and something that was fit to eat; but
ever since the rebs and the Yanks have got in
here and burned us out, things is all mussed up
and I don’t know which way to turn.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, you have money now,” said
his wife.</p>

<p>“Where did I get money? Not much I ain’t.
It has been this way ever since that old man Nickerson
came here to board. I didn’t agree to take
him for nothing, and I would not have done it if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
you hadn’t showed signs of getting up on your
ear.”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t. He gave you one
thousand dollars when he first came here, and you
said it would be more than enough to keep him
as long as he lived.”</p>

<p>“But I did not suppose he was going to last
forever, did I? He has chawed that up in tobacco
long ago; and every time I go to town I
am getting him a plug out of my own pocket.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that he has used up a
thousand dollars in three years?” asked Mrs.
Keeler, in a tone of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Now look at you. You seem to think that
amount of money will last forever. He has
chawed that up and more, too. He must have had
more than a thousand dollars when he came here.
The folks down to Manchester used to say he was
worth ten thousand dollars. What did you do
with all that money, old man?”</p>

<p>This question, addressed in no very amiable
tone of voice, was spoken to a person who was
seated in a remote corner of the cabin as if he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
was anxious to get out of reach of the speaker.
He was a very aged man, with white locks that
came down upon his shoulders and hands that
trembled in spite of all he could do to prevent it,
and there was something in his eyes and face
which he turned toward Jonas that would have
appealed to any heart except the heart of Jonas
Keeler. The old man was not in his right mind.
He had worked hard and laboriously, his hands
showed that, for the little money he possessed&mdash;Jonas
said it was more than a thousand dollars&mdash;but
those days were passed now. Something,
no one could have told exactly what it was, had
operated on his mind until he hardly knew what
he was doing. But there was one thing he did
know and that was that during the last year his
supply of tobacco had been extremely limited.
What Jonas did with the thousand dollars that
he gave him when he first came to his cabin and
took up his abode with him, no one ever knew.
Some believed that he had invested it in a mortgage
while others thought he had it stowed away
so that he could draw on it whenever necessity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
required it. At any rate his money went somewhere,
and Jonas never got him a thing when he
went to town without finding fault about it.</p>

<p>There had been a time when this Mr. Nickerson
who lived a short distance from Manchester,
was thought to be the richest person in all that
county. Every thing he had about him went to
show it. His horses were the fattest, his beef cattle
brought the most money and his farm was
nicely kept up. But the war broke out about this
time, and Mrs. Keeler often wondered what had
become of old man Nickerson who lived twenty
miles away. He had been the husband of her
sister, but since her death he had lived alone on
his farm. He often said that he would not go
into either army, he had no hand in bringing on
the war and those who were to blame for it could
settle the matter among themselves, and the consequence
was he was robbed by both Union and
Confederates. Every thing he had in sight was
gone except one thousand dollars, which he finally
gave into the hands of Jonas Keeler with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
understanding that the amount was to support
him while he lived.</p>

<p>“I don’t much like the idea of giving up my
money,” said Mr. Nickerson, after he had taken
a long time to think the matter over. “If I keep
it with me I can get tobacco and other little things
that I need; but now that I have let Jonas have
it,&mdash;I don’t know; I don’t know. The first thing
I know that thousand dollars will all be gone, and
then what will I do? We’ll see what sort of a
man Jonas is to live up to his word.”</p>

<p>Jonas Keeler did not believe in war either,
and he tried by every means in his power to keep
out of it. He hid in the woods when either army
came near him, and of course he lost everything
he had. The Confederates stole his horses and
cattle, and the Union fellows said if he were not
a rebel he ought to be, and burned his house over
his head. But Jonas had the thousand dollars
to go on and with this he was remarkably content.
He kept along until the war closed and then he
was ready to set out and make his living over
again; but he found that it was a hard thing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
do. It was tiresome work to get up where he was
before, he never grew any richer, and Jonas,
from being a quiet and peaceable man, became
sullen and morose, did not like to hear anybody
talk of spending money, even though he knew he
must spend some in order to live, and finally got
so that his family were afraid of him. There was
one thing that he never could get through his
head: Mr. Nickerson had never said anything
about what had become of the rest of his money,
and Jonas finally came to the conclusion that it
was concealed somewhere, and he wanted to know
where it was.</p>

<p>“You need not talk to me about that sum
being all the old man had,” said he, when he had
held one of his long arguments with his wife.
“He had more money than that and I know it.
What did he do when Daddy Price took him off
into the army? He buried it; that’s what he did
with it.”</p>

<p>“But the rebels must have got it,” said Mrs.
Keeler. “You know they went all over his house
and took everything there was in it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“But they never got any money,” said
Jonas. “The old man hangs onto a dollar until
the eagle hollers before he will give it up, and if
they had found anything he would not fail to say
so. He has got that money hidden somewhere,
and I wish I knew where it was. He makes me so
mad when he denies it, that I have half a mind
to take him by the scurf of the neck and throw
him out of doors.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, Jonas; don’t do that,” said
Mrs. Keeler in alarm. “The old gentleman is
getting feeble, I can see that plainly enough, and
the only way you can do is to treat him kindly.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Ain’t that what I have
been doing ever since he has been here?” demanded
Jonas in a heat. “I tell you that his
tobacco money is pretty near gone, and when it is
<i>all</i> gone he will not get any more. It is high time
he was quitting that bad habit.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Keeler made no remark when she heard
this. The idea that a man ninety years old could
cease a habit that he had been accustomed to all
his life, was absurd. Jonas himself really delighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in a good smoke. How would he feel if
he were deprived of that privilege? Furthermore,
his wife did not believe that all Mr. Nickerson’s
money was gone. She was certain that Jonas could
find a good deal of it if he looked
around and tried.</p>

<p>This conversation took place some time previous
to the beginning of our story. Mr. Nickerson’s
thousand dollars were nearly gone, at least
Jonas said so, and at the time we introduce them
to the reader it was all gone, and the old man did
not know what he would do next. He had not a
bit of that staff of life, as he regarded it, remaining,
and now Jonas wanted to know where he had
hidden the rest of his money. He had held a long
talk with the old man down to the stable but could
not get any thing out of him. That was one
thing that put him in such bad humor.</p>

<p>“What did you do with all that money, old
man?” repeated Jonas, when Mr. Nickerson
looked up at him with a sickly smile on his face.</p>

<p>“What money?” inquired the old gentleman,
as if he had never heard of the subject before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>“Aw! what money!” said Jonas; and when
he got into conversation on this matter he nearly
always forgot himself and shouted out the words
as if the man he was addressing were a mile away.
“I mean the money you had stowed away in your
pocket-book where the soldiers could not find it;
the money we were talking about down to the
barn. Where did you put it?”</p>

<p>“I gave you every cent I had left,” was the
reply. “If there was any more the rebels have
got it. Say, Jonas, are you going to get me a
plug of tobacco when you go down town?”</p>

<p>“There it is again. No, I ain’t. Your money
is all gone, and you will have to do without it
from this time on.”</p>

<p>Jonas started toward the door as if he were
in a hurry to get out, but before he had made
many steps he suddenly paused in his walk,
gazed steadily at the dirt floor and then turned to
Mr. Nickerson again.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember where a dollar or two
of that money went?” said he; and he tried to
make his voice as pleading as he knew how. “If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
you could remember that, I might find you a plug
or two of tobacco while I am down town.”</p>

<p>“There was no more of it in the purse other
than the money I gave you,” said the old man,
once more resting his forehead on his hands and
his elbows on his knees. “That was all I had left
to give you. You saw the inside of the purse as
plainly as I did.”</p>

<p>“But you must have some other that was not
in the purse,” said Jonas. “Where did you put
that?”</p>

<p>“All I had was there in my pocket and you
have got that. I want a plug of tobacco, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t get it out of me this trip,”
shouted Jonas. “If you won’t tell where your
money is you can go without tobacco.”</p>

<p>Jonas went out, climbed into his wagon and
drove off while the old man raised his head from
his hands, tottered to the door and watched him
as he was whirled away down the road. Then
he came back and seated himself on the chair
again.</p>

<p>“Jonas still sticks to it that I had more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
money in that purse than I gave him,” whined
Mr. Nickerson. “I hid it under the doorstep before
Price took me away to the army. He knew
that I was not able to do anything toward driving
the mules, I was too old; but he took me along
just to let me see that the Confederates ruled this
State instead of the Union people. He set me to
getting the mules out of the mud holes they got
into, but in a few days he saw that I was not of
any use at that, so he discharged me where I was
all of one hundred miles from home, and left me
to get there the best I could. I made it after
awhile, although I suffered severely while I was
doing it, found my thousand dollars right where
I had left it and came up here and gave it to
Jonas, consarn my picture. He said it would be
enough to get me all the tobacco and clothes I
needed, and now it is all gone. What I am going
to do beats me.”</p>

<p>“I have not got a cent, Mr. Nickerson,” said
Mrs. Keeler. “If I had I would give it to you in
a minute. I have not seen the color of any
body’s money since the war.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>“I know you haven’t, Mandy,” said Mr.
Nickerson. “I have not any kith nor kin of my
own, but you have always been good to me, and
some day&mdash;”</p>

<p>The old man started as if he had been shot,
looked all around him, his gaze resting on the
faces of the two boys who stood near the door listening
to what he had to say, and then hid his face
in his hands and burst into a loud cough, doubling
himself up as if he were almost strangled. Perhaps
the boys were taken by surprise&mdash;and perhaps
they were not; but Jonas’s wife was really
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Nickerson, what is the matter?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is nothing. It will pass off in a few
minutes. I get to coughing that way once in a
while.”</p>

<p>“Especially when you are going to say something
you don’t want to,” murmured one of the
boys under his breath. “And some day you are
going to pay mother for her goodness to you. I
wish I knew what you meant by that.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>The boys turned and left the cabin, but they
did not go in company with each other. In fact,
they tried to get as far apart as possible. There
was something wrong with them&mdash;a person could
see that at a glance. What these young fellows
had to make them enemies, living there in the
wilderness with not another house in sight, shall
be told further on.

<span class="medium"><i>A Friend In Need.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Nat,</span> what do you reckon he meant by
that?”</p>

<p>“Meant by what?”</p>

<p>“Why he said that mother had always been
good to him, and that some day&mdash;then he went off
coughing and didn’t say the rest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he has got some money stowed
away somewhere, as pap always said he had, and
that when he is gone mother will come into it. By
gracious! I wish I could find it.”</p>

<p>“Would you take it away from your
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I would. I would take it away
from any body. I need some clothes, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“You would have to go down to Manchester
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
if you got any money, and that is a long ways
from here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I would find it if I was there.
Are you going to get him any tobacco?”</p>

<p>“Me? What have I got to buy him tobacco
with? You talk as if I had lots of money hidden
away somewhere.”</p>

<p>“‘Cause if I see you slipping away any
where and I can’t find you, I will tell pap of it
when he comes home. You know what you will
get if I do that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you keep your eyes on me and see if
I slip away any where except down to the potato
patch,” said Nat, indignantly. “That is where
I am going now.”</p>

<p>The two boys separated and went off in different
directions, Nat wending his way to the potato
patch and the other going toward the miserable
hovel they called a barn to finish his task of
shelling corn.</p>

<p>“What a mean fellow that Nat Wood is,”
said Caleb Keeler, as he turned and gave his departing
companion a farewell look. “That boy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
has got as much as four or five dollars hidden
away about this place somewhere, and I tell you
I am going to find it some day. Then won’t I
have some clothes to wear? I’ve got a pair of
nice shoes which pap made him give me, but I
will have more if I find that money. Dog-gone
him, he has no business to keep things hidden
away from us.”</p>

<p>These two boys, Caleb Keeler and Nat Wood,
cherished the most undying hatred to one another,
and as far as Nat was concerned, there was
reason for it. It was all on account of his lost
shoes, and they had been taken away from him a
year ago. The weather was getting cold, every
morning the grass and leaves were wet and it was
as much as a bare-footed boy wanted to do to run
around in them, and Nat had prepared for it by
going down to the store one evening and purchasing
a pair of brogans and two pairs of stockings.
He fully expected to get into trouble on account
of them, and sure enough he did. The next morning
he came out with them on, and his appearance
was enough to create astonishment on Caleb’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
part who stood and looked at him with mouth
and eyes wide open.</p>

<p>“Well, if you haven’t got a pair of shoes I
never want to see daylight again,” said Caleb,
as soon as he had recovered from his amazement.
“Where did you get them?”</p>

<p>“I bought them,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Where did you buy them?”</p>

<p>“Down to the store.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your money?”</p>

<p>“I earned it.”</p>

<p>“You did, eh? Well, you ain’t been a doing
any thing about here to earn any money,” declared
Caleb, after he had fairly taken in the situation.
“If you have money to buy a pair of shoes
you can get a pair for me too. How much did
they cost you?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any more of them bills?”</p>

<p>“Not another bill,” said Nat; and to prove
it he turned his pockets inside out. There was
nothing in them except a worn jack-knife with all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the blades broken which nobody would steal if he
had the chance.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for what you have in your
pockets,” exclaimed Caleb, who grew angry in a
moment. “You have got more hidden around in
the bushes somewhere. You want to get two dollars
between this time and the time we get
through breakfast, now I tell you. I will go down
to the store with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t do it,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“If you don’t do it I will tell pap.”</p>

<p>“You can run and tell him as soon as you
please. If you want shoes, go to work and earn
the money.”</p>

<p>Caleb waited to hear no more. He dropped
the milk bucket as if it were a coal of fire and
walked as straight toward the house as he could
go. He slammed the door behind him but in two
minutes he reappeared, accompanied by his
father. Things began to look dark for Nat.</p>

<p>“There, sir, I have lost my shoes,” said he.
“If Uncle Jonas takes these away from me he
will be the meanest man I ever saw. They are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
mine and I don’t see why I can not be allowed to
keep them.”</p>

<p>When Jonas came up he did not appear so
cross as he usually did. In fact he tried to smile,
but Nat knew there was something back of it.</p>

<p>“Hallo, where did you get them shoes, Natty?”
was the way in which he began the conversation.</p>

<p>“I got them down to the store,” was the reply,
“and Caleb wants me to buy him a pair; but
I have not got the money to do it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you reckon you could find two extry
dollars somewhere?” said Jonas.</p>

<p>“No, nor one dollar. I will tell you what I
will do,” said Nat, seeing that the smile of his
uncle’s face speedily gave way to his usual fierce
frown. “I will tell you right where my money is
hidden and then Caleb can go and find it.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s business,” said Caleb, smiling
all over.</p>

<p>“If you will do that then me and you won’t
have any trouble about them shoes,” chimed in
Jonas, once more calling the smile to his face.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
“Where have you got it? How many years have
you been here, Natty?” continued Jonas, for just
then an idea occurred to him. “You have been
here just eleven years&mdash;you are fourteen now&mdash;and
you have kept that money hidden out there
in the brush all this while. Now why did you do
that?”</p>

<p>It was right on the point of Nat’s tongue to
tell Jonas that he did not have the money when
he came there, but he knew that by so doing he
would bring some body else into trouble; so he
said nothing.</p>

<p>“I was older than you and knew more, and
you ought to have given me the money to keep for
you,” continued Jonas. “If you had done that
you could have come to me any time that you
wanted a pair of shoes, and you could have got
them without the least trouble.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take what there is left in my bag
after you see it?” asked Nat, hopefully.</p>

<p>“That depends. I want first to see how
much you have in that bag. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Caleb, you know where that old fallen log
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
is beside the branch near the place where we get
water?” said Nat. “Well, go on the off side of
that and you will see leaves pushed against the
log. Brush aside the leaves and there you will
find the bag.”</p>

<p>Caleb at once posted off and Jonas, after
looking in vain for a seat, turned the milk bucket
upside down, perched himself upon it and resumed
his mild lecture to Nat over keeping his
money hidden from him for so many years. He
was the oldest and knew more about money than
Nat did, he was a little fellow when he came there&mdash;when
Jonas reached this point in his lecture he
stopped and looked steadily at the floor. Nat was
only three years old when he came to take up his
abode under the roof of Jonas Keeler, to be
abused worse than any dog that ever lived, both
by Jonas and his son Caleb, and how could he at
that tender age hide away his money so that
Jonas could not find it?</p>

<p>“Wh-o-o-p!” yelled Jonas, speaking out before
he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” inquired Nat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>“Nothing much,” replied Jonas. “I was
just a-thinking; that’s all. If Nat was only three
years old when he came here to live with me,” he
added to himself, “he couldn’t have had that
money. Somebody has given it to him since, and
it was not so very long ago, either. Whoop!”
and it was all he could do to keep from uttering
the words out loud. “He has got it from the old
man; there’s where he got it from. And didn’t
I say that the old man had something hidden out
all these years? He didn’t give me a quarter of
what he saved from the rebels. Now he has got
to give me that money or there’s going to be a
fracas in this house. I won’t keep him no longer.
You can bet on that.”</p>

<p>At this point in his meditations Jonas was
interrupted by the return of his son who was
coming along as though he had nothing to live
for, swinging his hand with the bag in it to let
his father believe that there was nothing in it
that he cared to save.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Jonas.</p>

<p>“I have found the bag but there is nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
in it, dog-gone the luck,” sputtered Caleb.
“There is just a ‘shinplaster’ in it and it calls for
two bits. Where is the rest of your money?” he
added, turning fiercely upon Nat.</p>

<p>“That is all I have,” replied Nat. “It was
in that bag, wasn’t it? Then I have no more to
give you.”</p>

<p>Jonas took the bag, glanced at the shinplaster
and put it into his pocket. The smile had
now given away to the frown.</p>

<p>“Say, pap, ain’t you going to give that to
me!” asked Caleb, who began to see that the interest
he had taken in unearthing Nat’s money
was not going to help very much.</p>

<p>“No; you can’t get no shoes with that money.
I will take it and get some coffee with it the next
time I go to town. Is this all the money you have
left, Nat?”</p>

<p>“Every cent; and now you are going to take
that away from me, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course; for I think it is the properest
thing to do. You don’t ever go to church&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what is the reason I don’t? It is because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
I have not got any clothes to wear,” said
Nat, who plainly saw what was coming next.</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” said Jonas.
“Caleb goes to church, and he would go every
Sunday if he had the proper things.”</p>

<p>“You bet I would,” said Caleb.</p>

<p>“So I think that if you don’t go to church
and Caleb does, you had better take off them
shoes. Take them off and give them to Caleb.”</p>

<p>“Now, Uncle Jonas, you are not going to
make me go bare-footed this cold weather,” said
Nat, anxiously. “If Caleb wants shoes let him
go to work and earn them.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go to work about here,” said Caleb.
“There’s nobody will hire me to do a thing.”</p>

<p>“Because you are too lazy; that’s what’s the
matter with you,” said Nat, under his breath.</p>

<p>“Take off them shoes,” said Jonas.</p>

<p>Nat hesitated, but it was only for an instant.
Jonas was not the man to allow his orders to be
disobeyed with impunity, so he arose from his
seat on the milk bucket with alacrity, disappeared
in a little room where he kept a switch which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
had often used on the boys when they did anything
that Jonas considered out of the way, and
when he brought it out with him he found Nat on
the floor taking off his shoes.</p>

<p>“You have come to time, have you?” said
the man with a grin. “So you are going to take
them off and give them to Caleb, are you?”</p>

<p>“I am going to take them off because I can’t
well help myself,” said Nat, boldly. “If I was
as big as you are I would not take them off.”</p>

<p>“None of that sort of talk to me,” said
Jonas, lifting the switch as if he were about to let
it fall upon Nat’s shoulders. “You would take
them off if you were as big as a mountain.”</p>

<p>When he had removed his shoes Caleb picked
them up and in company with his father started
toward the house. He wanted to put them where
they would be safe, and Nat stood there in his
bare feet watching him until he closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>We have not referred to the relationship
which Nat bore to Jonas Keeler, but no doubt those
into whose hands this story falls will be surprised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
to hear it. Jonas was his uncle, and, by the way,
Mr. Nickerson was no relation to any body under
that roof. Nat’s father and mother were dead;
his father was killed in the rebel army. Jonas
found him in Manchester and brought him home
“to keep him safe and sound;” at least that was
what he said; but those who knew Jonas thought
that the reason was because he suspected that Nat
was heir to some money which would some day
turn up in his favor. He did not see where the
money was to come from, but he believed it, and
that was enough. The truth of the matter was,
Nat did not have a cent. After he had been
there for some years Jonas began to think so too,
and from that time his treatment of Nat was anything
but what it ought to be. It was only when
Mr. Nickerson began to take an interest in him
that Nat had anything that he could call his own.
He did not like the way Nat was abused&mdash;he was
in his right mind then and hale and hearty in
spite of his years&mdash;and took pity on him and determined
to help him. That was where Nat’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
money came from, and the way he happened to
get it was this:</p>

<p>One day, when Jonas went to town, Mr.
Nickerson watched his opportunity and followed
him out to the field where he was at work alone.
Nat greeted him very cordially for he was always
glad to see him. Mr. Nickerson was the only one
except Mrs. Keeler, who had a kind word to say
to him, and Nat remembered him for it.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I would do if Jonas
abused me as badly as he does you?” said he.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t,” replied Nat.</p>

<p>“I would sit down and rest. He has gone
away to town now, and when he comes home he
can’t tell whether you have been at work or not.”</p>

<p>The boy leaned on his plow handles&mdash;he was
eight years old and ought not to have been required
to do that sort of work&mdash;and looked at
Mr. Nickerson without speaking. He wanted to
see if the man was in earnest.</p>

<p>“Jonas knows just how much I ought to have
done, and when he comes home and finds that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
have not got it all done, he will use that switch
on me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nickerson saw that there was some sense
in this reasoning, and after kicking some clods
out of his way and looking toward the house to
make sure that there was no one watching him,
he went on to say&mdash;</p>

<p>“Jonas uses you pretty rough, does he not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I will be a man some day, and then I
will take it out of him, I bet you,” said Nat; and
when he uttered the words he clenched his hands
and his eyes flashed as if there were plenty of
spirit in him.</p>

<p>“But that is going to be a long time for you
to wait. If you had money do you think you
could hide it where Jonas and Caleb could not
find it?”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got any,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“But I say supposing you had some; could
you keep it out of their reach?” said Mr. Nickerson,
when he saw Nat’s eyes brighten when he
thought of all the fine things that money would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
buy for him. “If you don’t keep it out of their
way you will get me into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Were you going to give me some money?”
stammered Nat.</p>

<p>“I had thought some of it,” said the man,
lowering his voice almost to a whisper and glancing
again toward the house. “I have some
money but I dare not keep it. Last night while
I was awake, I saw Jonas come in very quietly
and go through my trousers’ pocket; but he did
not find any money there. If he had looked under
the head of my bed close to the wall, he would
have found two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Nickerson spoke he had drawn a
well-filled book from his pocket, opened it and
showed to the astonished boy a whole lot of greenbacks
which he had stowed away there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="medium">“<i>Mental Reservation.</i>”</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Nat</span> had never seen so much money before
in his life. He thought if he were worth
that much that he would drop the plow
handles then and there and take to the woods.</p>

<p>“Where did you get so much?” he stammered
at length.</p>

<p>“I worked for it, and that’s the way Jonas
will have to get every cent he makes,” said Mr.
Nickerson. “What would you do if you had all
this money?”</p>

<p>“I would go down to the store and buy some
new over-alls,” replied Nat, pushing out one leg
so that Mr. Nickerson could see the gaping rent
in his knee. “They haven’t been mended since
I put them on.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and then when Jonas comes home he
would see the new over-alls and would want to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
know where you got them. That plan would
not work at all, for the first thing you know you
would get me into trouble as well as yourself.
Now I am going to give you half of this, because
I think you are too smart a boy to let it fall into
the hands of any body else.”</p>

<p>“But what shall I do with it? If you think
Jonas will notice my new clothes when he comes
home, I can’t buy any.”</p>

<p>“I don’t give it to you to buy good clothes
with. In fact you had better let them alone. But
when I was of your age I liked to have something
to eat when I went to town of a Saturday afternoon&mdash;some
candy and nuts and such like
things.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever a boy?” said Nat, in surprise.
The idea that that old, gray-headed man
could remember so long ago as that fairly took
his breath away.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I can remember when I was a boy,
and it don’t seem so very far off, either. I was a
young boy, bare-footed as yourself, but I always
had money. My father let me have it all, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
never thought of running away from him to get
a chance to spend it. You don’t get much candy,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I hardly know what it tastes
like.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go down town and ask the grocery
man to change one of these bills for you.
You see they are all fives, and if you don’t spend
more than ten cents at a time and keep the rest
hidden away, it will be long before any body finds
out that you have got any money.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Nickerson spoke he glanced toward
the house again, looked all around to make sure
that there was nobody in sight, and placed a
handful of bills in Nat’s grasp, reaching down
by the side of him so that no one could see him
do it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Nickerson, you don’t know how
much I thank you for&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand all about that. But
there is something else that I want to talk to you
about. I want you to get me some tobacco with
that money.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>“I’ll do it, and Jonas and Caleb won’t know
a thing about it. I will hide it where they will
never think of looking for it.”</p>

<p>“That is what I wanted,” said Mr. Nickerson,
with a pleased smile on his face. “But you
must be very careful. Don’t take but one bill at
a time, and then if anybody should see you and
take it away from you, they won’t get all the
money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nickerson turned abruptly away from
him and walked toward the house, and Nat, feeling
as he had never felt before, seized the plow
handles and went on with his work. He glanced
up and down the field and toward the house to
satisfy himself that Caleb was not in sight, and
when he went by a little clump of bushes that
grew at the lower end of the lot he dropped the
plow, took the reins off his neck and ran toward
a fence corner and took his bills from his pocket.</p>

<p>“I guess this place will do until I can find
a better one,” he muttered, as he scraped away
the leaves and placed his treasure within it.
“By gracious! It is always darkest just before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
day-light. And how do you suppose that Mr.
Nickerson knew that I was planning to run away
from Jonas? Now I tell you that he had better
keep a civil tongue in his head or the first thing
he knows when he calls me in the morning, and
comes to my bed to use that switch on me because
I don’t get up, I won’t be there. But then I can’t
go as long as Mr. Nickerson lasts. He will want
me to get some tobacco for him.”</p>

<p>Nat laid ninety-five dollars in the hole which
he had dug for it, placed a chunk over it so that
the leaves would not blow off and with a five-dollar
bill safe in his pocket he returned to his
work. He wanted to yell, he felt so happy; but
when he raised his eyes as he turned his horse
about, he saw Caleb standing in the upper end
of the clump of bushes, regarding him intently.
How long had Caleb been there and what had he
seen? There was one thing about it: If he knew,
the secret of that money he would have the hardest
fight of his life before he placed his hands
upon it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” said Caleb,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
who did not fail to notice the look that came upon
Nat’s face.</p>

<p>“There is nothing the matter with me,” said
Nat. “I don’t see why I should do all the work
and you sitting around and doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“What was old man Nickerson doing out
here so long with you?” asked Caleb, who did
not think it worth while to go into an argument
about the work that Nat had spoken of. “He
was here with you for half an hour, and you had
all this piece of ground to be plowed up before
pap came home. And you stayed here and listened
to him, too.”</p>

<p>“Where were you?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“I was around in the barn where I could
see everything you did,” replied Caleb, with a
knowing shake of his head.</p>

<p>“What did you see him do?”</p>

<p>“I saw him talking to you; that’s what I saw
him do. You wasted fully half an hour with
him.”</p>

<p>Nat drew a long breath of relief and felt considerably
more at ease when he heard this, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
if that was all that Caleb had seen, the secret of
his money was safe. He had not seen Mr. Nickerson
when he passed his hand down by his side
and placed the bills safe in Nat’s hands.</p>

<p>“What was he talking to you about?” demanded
Caleb.</p>

<p>“About certain things that happened when
he was a boy,” returned Nat. “If you wanted
to hear what he said you ought to have come out
and listened. But I must go on or I will not get
this piece plowed by the time your father comes
back. Get up here, you ugly man’s horse.”</p>

<p>“Now you just wait and see if I don’t tell
pap of that,” said Caleb, who grew angry in a
moment. “I learn you to call pap’s horse ugly.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he was ugly. I said he belonged
to an ugly man; and if your father did not
look mad when he went to town, just because Mr.
Nickerson wanted some tobacco, I don’t want a
cent.”</p>

<p>The horse, after being persuaded by the
lines, reluctantly resumed his work and Caleb
was left there standing alone. There was something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
about Nat that did not look right to him.
He always was independent, and acted as though
he did not care whether Caleb spoke to him or
not, but just now he seemed to be more so than
ever.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what was up between that
boy Nat and old man Nickerson,” said he, as he
started out toward the barn. “Every move that
old man makes I think he has got some money
hidden somewhere about here. Pap thinks so
and so do I. I just keep a watch of Nat more
closely than I have heretofore, and if I can find
his money&mdash;whoop-pe!”</p>

<p>Jonas did not find any fault when he came
home that night, for Nat, by keeping the horses
almost in a trot, had got the field plowed, the
team unharnessed and fed before he returned. He
found fault with him and brought his switch into
play more than once on other matters, but during
the five years that elapsed he never said
“money” to him once. During these five years
he always kept his money concealed, and every
time he went to town he always bought a goodly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
store of tobacco for the old man. And nobody
ever suspected him or Mr. Nickerson, either. Of
course, during this time, Jonas became more sullen
and ugly than ever, and worse than all, Nat
could see that there was something having an
affect upon his old friend, Mr. Nickerson.
Either it was his age or the treatment he received
that had a gloomy impression upon him, but at
any rate Mr. Nickerson was losing his mind. He
no longer talked with Nat the way he used to, but
was continually finding fault with his money and
where it went to so suddenly that he could not
get any more tobacco to chew to help him while
away the hours. Jonas encouraged him to talk
this way for somehow he got it into his head that
Mr. Nickerson would some day forget himself,
and that he would tell where he had hidden his
money; but not a thing did he get out of him.
The old gentleman was apparently as innocent
of any thing he had concealed as though he had
never heard any thing about it.</p>

<p>“You may as well give that up,” said his
wife, after Jonas had tried for a long time to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
induce him to say something. “If he had any
money when the war broke out, the rebels have
got it.”</p>

<p>“Not much I won’t give it up,” declared
Jonas, turning fiercely upon Mrs. Keeler. “If
this old place could talk it would tell a heap. I
have hunted it over and over time and again,
but I can’t find any thing. I tell you I am going
to get rid of him some day. I will send him to
the poor house; and there’s where he ought to
be.”</p>

<p>When Nat heard Jonas talk in this way it
always made him uneasy. As soon as it came
dark he would go to the place where he had hidden
his tobacco and money and take them out
and conceal them somewhere else, carefully noting
the spot and telling the old man about it.</p>

<p>At the end of five years his money was all
gone, and then Nat was in a fever of suspense
because he did not know where he was going to
get some more tobacco for Mr. Nickerson and
candy for himself; and when he was asked for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
more he was obliged to say that his tobacco
money had all been exhausted.</p>

<p>“Well, I expected it,” said Mr. Nickerson.
“But it has lasted you a good while, has it not?
There’s some difference between you and Jonas.
I gave him all of a thousand dollars when I came
here&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nat fairly gasped for breath. He wondered
what Jonas could have done with all that money.</p>

<p>“It is a fact,” said the old man. “He told
me that it would keep me in spending money
as long as I lived, and now it has been gone for
several years. You had a hundred dollars, and
it has lasted until now. You go out to the barn
and in about half an hour I will be out there.”</p>

<p>Like one in a dream Nat made his way to
the tumble-down building that afforded the cattle
a place of refuge in stormy weather, and
looked around for something to do while he
awaited Mr. Nickerson’s return. If we were to
say that he was surprised we would not have
expressed it. Was the old man made of money?
It certainly looked that way, for when a hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
dollars was gone he simply said “he had expected
it” and went out to find more. In a few
minutes he returned and placed another package
of bills in Nat’s pocket.</p>

<p>“Do you know you told a lie to Jonas every
time he asked you about this money?” said Nat.</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” said Mr. Nickerson, earnestly.
“I told him that I did not have any more
money for him; and I didn’t have, either. I
have not got a cent about me.”</p>

<p>Nat was not old enough to remember the
form of oath administered by the United States
government to all its employees&mdash;“do you solemnly
promise without any mental reservation”&mdash;for
if he had been he would have seen how Mr. Nickerson
got around it. Jonas did not administer
this form of oath, Mr. Nickerson had a “mental
reservation” that he had some money hidden
but he did not say anything about it. He supposed
that he was living up to the truth.</p>

<p>“I did not have a cent,” repeated the old
“He could have searched me all over and
not found any. When he asked me if I had
man. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
any more concealed somewhere in the bushes, I
found some way to avoid it. It is all right. I
have not lied to him.”</p>

<p>With a hundred extra dollars in his pocket
Nat thought he was able to buy himself a pair of
shoes when the weather became cold. He bought
them and as we have seen they were taken away
from him and given to Caleb, because Caleb went
to church and Nat did not. He had to wait a
long time before Jonas bought him some foot-wearing
apparel out of some of Mr. Nickerson’s
money, and then he invested in them because he
was fearful that his neighbors would have something
to say about the boy’s condition, going
about in all that sloppy weather with nothing
to wear on his bare feet. This brings us down
to the time when our story begins, when Jonas
got into his wagon and drove toward town and
Nat went to the potato patch to finish picking
and digging and Caleb to the barn to complete
his task of shelling corn.</p>

<p>We left Mr. Nickerson sitting in company
with Jonas’s wife, bemoaning his loss of tobacco
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and trembling for fear of something he had said
in regard to what he would do with his money in
case he were done with it.</p>

<p>“I wish I had some money so that I could
give you some of it when I am gone,” whined
the old man. “For I shall not last much
longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you will,” returned Mrs. Keeler.
“You will last many years yet. There is Mr.
Bolton who is almost a hundred years old.”</p>

<p>“But he gets different treatment from what
I do,” said Mr. Nickerson. “He has tobacco
every day in the week, if he is a mind to ask for
it. And he did not give his son one thousand
dollars to keep him while he lived.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help that,” said Mrs. Keeler,
with a sigh. “Your money is all gone, at least
Jonas says so, and I don’t see what else you can
do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t either,” said the old man; and as
he spoke he got upon his feet and staggered toward
the door. “Thank goodness I have a little
money left,” he added to himself. “I must go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and get me some tobacco. I have to be all by
myself when Jonas is here, or else he would see
me chewing it and would want to know where I
got it. I hate to be so sly about everything I do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nickerson left the house without any hat
on, he was so wrapped up in his troubles that he
forgot that he had a hat, and tottered toward the
barn where Caleb was at work shelling corn.
Caleb looked up when he heard his footsteps but
when he saw who it was he went on with his
work, paying no heed to him. The old man
went by and just then an idea occurred to Caleb.</p>

<p>“I wonder if old Nickerson is going after
some tobacco?” said he, laying down his ear of
corn and rising hastily to his feet. “He thinks
I am blind and Nat does, too; but I have seen
him chewing tobacco plenty of times when he has
asked father to get him some and he would not
do it. I guess I’ll keep an eye on him.”</p>

<p>That was easy enough to do, for Mr. Nickerson
did not pay much attention to what was going
on near him. He stepped hastily out of the barn
and followed along after him until he saw him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
enter the little clump of bushes at the lower end
of the potato patch. He did not dare go any
farther for fear the rustling of the bushes would
attract the old man’s attention, but kept on
around the clump until he reached a place where
he could see the whole of the field without being
seen himself. Mr. Nickerson presently appeared,
kept on to a certain fence corner in which he
was lost to view.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone my buttons! He has got some
money there,” whispered Caleb, so excited that
he could scarcely stand still. “If he hasn’t got
money he has some tobacco, and I will just take it
when he goes.”</p>

<p>While he was wondering how he was going
to work to find out what Mr. Nickerson had found
there, he cast his eyes toward the upper end of
the field and saw that Nat had ceased his work,
was standing with his hands resting on his hips
and closely watching Mr. Nickerson. He made
no attempt to stop him, and according to Caleb’s
way of looking at it, that was all the evidence he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
wanted to prove that Nat was in some way interested
in what was hidden there.</p>

<p>“Now what is to be done?” said Caleb to
himself. “Nat must know what is concealed
there. I declare I have two fellows to fight
now.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>A Keepsake.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Caleb</span> stood and thought about it. He
could not go to the fence corner where the
old man was while Nat was in plain sight,
and he must think up some way of getting him
away from there. It is true that he might have
waited until darkness came to conceal his movements,
but Caleb was a boy who did not believe
in doing business that way. He wanted to find
out what was in that fence corner, and he must
find it out now. He could not afford to wait
until night came.</p>

<p>“You must come away from there, Mister
Nat,” said he, as he crouched down behind the
bushes and made his way toward the house.
“You must come away in five minutes, for I am
not going to run any risk of your slipping up and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
hiding that thing, whatever it is, that the old
man has found.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes he reached the house and
went directly to the water-pail in order to quench
his thirst; but there was no water there.</p>

<p>“Mother, send Nat down to the branch after
some water,” said he.</p>

<p>“Suppose you go yourself,” was the reply.
“Nat is busy digging potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go. I am busy getting that corn
ready for pap to take to mill tomorrow. I am
so thirsty I can’t speak the truth. Nat can go
as well as not.”</p>

<p>“Bessie, go out and call Nat to get some
water,” said Mrs. Keeler. “I suppose he will
have to go.”</p>

<p>Bessie went, and as soon as she was clear of
the house Caleb bent his steps toward the barn
and from the barn to the bushes, where he arrived
just in time to see Mr. Nickerson come out
of the fence corner, biting a plug of tobacco as
he came.</p>

<p>“That’s all the tobacco you will get out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
that pile,” chuckled Caleb, as he rubbed his
hands together. “I will take it all and give it
to pap.”</p>

<p>Presently Bessie was heard calling Nat.
The latter threw his hoe spitefully down and
went to obey the order, and as soon as he was
out of sight Caleb arose from the bushes and ran
for the fence corner. He had taken particular
pains to mark the corner, and in fact there was
little need of it, for the old man’s marks were
plainly visible there. He found the leaves raked
to one side, a little hollow exposed but there
was nothing in it. Caleb threw himself on his
knees and made the cavity larger, but there was
not a thing that rewarded his search.</p>

<p>“There was just one plug of tobacco left and
he got it,” said Caleb, who was very much disappointed.
“And there’s no money in it either.
Now had I better tell pap or not? There is a
heap of skirmishing going on here, the first thing
you know, and if I keep watch perhaps I can
find some money. I guess I’ll think about that
for awhile.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>Being anxious to reach the cover of the
bushes before Nat should return, Caleb did not
stop long in the fence corner, but made all haste
to get out of sight. And he was none too soon.
The bushes had hardly closed up behind him before
Nat came into view.</p>

<p>When darkness came the boys began to do
their chores and Jonas returned from town.
One could always tell Jonas when he was half a
mile away because he shouted at his horses as
though they were hard of hearing. Mr. Nickerson
heard him coming and went down to the
barn to meet him.</p>

<p>“Did you get any tobacco for me, Jonas?”
said he, in a whining voice which had of late
years become habitual with him.</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” roared Jonas. “You won’t
tell me where your money is, and you can go
without tobacco. I wish there was something
else you liked as well as you do that weed, and
I would shut down on that too.”</p>

<p>“I shall not be with you long,” began Mr.
Nickerson. “I feel that I am going&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>“Aw! Get along with, that,” interrupted
Jonas, who hung one of his harnesses on its peg
and then turned savagely upon the speaker.
“You have always got something the matter with
you when you don’t get any tobacco.”</p>

<p>“I have a keepsake for you up at the house,”
continued the old man. “If you will come up
there when you get through I will give it to you.”</p>

<p>Jonas began to prick up his ears at this. He
wished now that he had brought the old gentleman
some tobacco; but as he had not done it, he
made all haste to smooth matters over as well
as he could.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything, Mr. Nickerson,”
said he, coming forward to shake him by the
hand. “But I met with a heap of bother while
I was down town to-day, and I absolutely forgot
all about your tobacco. Never mind; I will send
Nat down after it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Thank you,” said the old
man. “It will be a heap of comfort to me. You
don’t know how long the time seems without it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I like a smoke pretty well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and I would not give it up to please anybody.
Now you run along to the house and in a few
minutes I will be there. A keepsake,” he muttered
to himself. “It is money, I know. I believe
I took the right course when I shut down on
that man’s weed.”</p>

<p>It was astonishing what that word “keepsake”
made in Jonas’s feelings. He had but two
expressions which came to his face&mdash;the smile
and the frown. No one to have seen him as he
finished putting out his team, would have thought
that a frown ever came on his countenance. He
was all smiles, and once or twice he forgot himself
so as to try to strike up a whistle. This attracted
the attention of Caleb who was amazed at
it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, pap?” said he.</p>

<p>“There is nothing the matter with me,” replied
Jonas, cheerfully. “When a man does
right he always feels happy. That’s the kind
of opinion you want to grow up with. If you
make everybody around you jovial, of course you
are jovial yourself.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>“Are you happy because you didn’t get the
old man what he wanted?” continued Caleb, who
would have given everything he had to know
what had brought about that wonderful change
in his father’s appearance. Caleb knew that he
could bring the frown back to his face in short
order. He had but to mention that the old man
had a plug of tobacco in his pocket, and that he
had seen him dig it out of the fence corner; but
something told him that he had better keep quiet.
He was going to keep close watch of Nat and Mr.
Nickerson now&mdash;he did not know how he was
going to do it, for he kept close watch of them
already&mdash;and perhaps they would lead him to the
place where they had concealed some money.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that is a point that I want you to
remember all your life,” Jonas went on. “I forgot
all about Mr. Nickerson’s tobacco, and that
was the reason I didn’t bring it. But I will make
up for it after supper. Have you milked, Caleb?
Then pick up your pail and let’s go up to the
house. A keepsake,” Jonas kept saying to himself,
as he walked along. “He knows that I want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
money worse than anything else, and that was
what he meant. The idea that he should keep
money in that house so long, and I was looking
everywhere for it!”</p>

<p>Jonas was in a hurry, anybody could have
seen that and he kept Caleb in a trot to keep
pace with him. When he opened the door he
greeted his wife with a cheerful “hello!” and
picked up his youngest child and kissed him.
Mrs. Keeler was as much amazed at his actions
as Caleb was. She stood in the middle of the
floor with her arms down by her side and her
mouth open, seemingly at a loss to comprehend
his movements.</p>

<p>“Now, then, where is Mr. Nickerson?” said
Jonas, pulling an empty chair toward him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nickerson,” said Caleb to himself.
“There is something in the wind there. He never
called him Mr. Nickerson before unless he had
something to make out of him. He was always
‘that old man’ or ‘that inspired idiot’ when he
wanted him to do errands for him. What’s up,
I wonder?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>“I forgot all about his tobacco,” said Jonas,
seating himself and repeating what he had said
to Caleb. “I had a heap of trouble down town,
but I will send Nat down after it as soon as we
get a bite to eat. Ah, Mr. Nickerson, you are
on hand, I see. What’s this?”</p>

<p>The old man had in his hand the “keepsake”
which he intended to give to Jonas. It was a
book bound in cloth. It had been well-read evidently,
for some of the leaves were loose and one
cover was nearly off. But the leaves were all
there, and there was <i>something</i> in it that Jonas
did not know anything about; if he had known
it he would have received it very differently.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Jonas.</p>

<p>“It is the keepsake I promised you,” said
Mr. Nickerson. “Take it, read every word of
it and you will find something in it before you
get through that will make you open your eyes
and bless your lucky stars that you have been so
good to me.”</p>

<p>Jonas took the book and ran his thumb over
the leaves. He turned the back of the book toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
him and read the name “Baxter’s Saints’
Rest” on it in gilt type. The expression of intense
disgust that came upon his face when he
looked at the book set Caleb to snickering, and
even Nat, who was leaning against the door post
a little distance away, smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“And is this the only keepsake you have got
to give me?” shouted Jonas.</p>

<p>“It is the only one,” said Mr. Nickerson.
“Read it carefully, every word of it, and you
will thank me for giving it to you.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” exclaimed Jonas,
who could not get that thing out of his mind.</p>

<p>“You have got all the money I have to give
you. I gave you a thousand dollars&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jonas became furious all on a sudden. With
a muttered exclamation under his breath, he
drew back the book with the intention of throwing
at the old man’s head; but he stayed his hand
in time. Then he turned it upon Caleb; but
the boy had rushed out of the door and was safe.
But Nat stood there, he had not moved at all, and
instantly the book left Jonas’s hand and flew with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
terrific force at the boy’s head. It struck the
door post and bounded out of doors, and Nat
slowly straightened up and went after it. It was
a work of some difficulty to pick it up, for the
leaves were scattered in every direction, but Nat
got it done at last and went away with it.</p>

<p>“Jonas, Jonas, you will be sorry for that,”
said Mr. Nickerson, who covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>“Get out of here! Get out, you inspired
idiot!” roared Jonas, striding up and down the
cabin as if he were demented. “Don’t you dare
come into this house again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” exclaimed Mrs. Keeler.</p>

<p>“Shut up your yawp, old woman,” said Jonas,
turning upon her. “That was the keepsake
he had to give to me, was it? I thought it was
money, dog-gone it, and here he comes and presents
me with a <i>book</i>! He shan’t stay in my
house no longer.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nickerson went out and tottered to the
barn, and when Nat found him there a few minutes
later he was doubled up with his elbows on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
his knees, but his jaws were working vigorously.
If there was nothing else which could comfort
him, he found it in his tobacco.</p>

<p>“Here’s your book, Mr. Nickerson,” said
Nat, who, if he had been big enough, would have
resented the way the old man had been treated.
“Shall I take it back and put it among your
things?”</p>

<p>“No; never mind that now. Jonas has told
me that I can not go into his house again, and he
may rest assured that I will never do it.”</p>

<p>“He did not mean what he said,” exclaimed
Nat. “He is all over his passion by this time.”</p>

<p>“It is too late. He will never see a cent of
my money. Did you put those leaves all in
just as you found them?”</p>

<p>“I tried, but I reckon I did not succeed very
well.”</p>

<p>“Did you find anything that did not belong
there?”</p>

<p>“I found two leaves that were pasted together,”
said Nat, and he grew excited at once
when he saw the expression that came upon Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Nickerson’s face. “Did you know about those
two leaves?”</p>

<p>“Have you brought them with you?”</p>

<p>“I have. I would have left the whole book
behind before I would them, for I knew they
meant something,” said Nat, producing them
from his pocket the leaves of which he had spoken.
“Now, by holding it up to the light this
way,” he added, “in order to see what was in
them, I can see through the leaves, and I can see
a third piece of paper in there.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and there is something on that paper,
too,” said the old man rising to his feet and going
toward the door. “We must first make sure
that there is nobody coming; for you have a fortune
right there in your hands.”</p>

<p>“A fortune?” gasped Nat.</p>

<p>“It was the money I had in the bank at the
time the war broke out,” said Mr. Nickerson,
who, having looked up and down the place and
toward the house to satisfy himself that he and
Nat were safe from intrusion, returned to his
seat. “It is all in gold, too.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>“How-how much is there of it?” said Nat,
who did not know whether to believe the story or
not.</p>

<p>“As much as three or four thousand dollars;
perhaps more; I did not count it. You see
I drew this money at different times, and as fast
as I got it, I hid it. When the rebels came there
and took me away, they searched the house high
and low for some money that they supposed I
had, but it was not in the house; It was out in
the field. You see this black line?” he continued,
taking the two leaves and pointing with his shivering
finger to one of the marks on the inclosed
paper. “By the way, you don’t want to take
this out until you are already to go to work,
for fear that somebody may steal it from you.
Well, you go to the house&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how can I tell where it is?” cried Nat.
“Those men cleaned you out. They thought
they would get something by doing that.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t, so they might as well have
left me my house. However, it don’t matter
much now. I shall never live in it again. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
can tell where the house stood, even if it isn’t
there now, can’t you? You go to the corner of
that house nearest the woods, hold this paper
before you and follow as straight a course as you
can down the hill and across the break until you
come to a brier patch. It is made up entirely of
briers, for I cut them down and put them there.
Then leave that to your right and go thirty yards
and you will strike a stone, as big as you can lift,
which does not look as though it had ever been
touched. But it has been, and you can pry it
up if you want to. When you get that stone
out of its place, you dig down about two feet, and
there you will find it.”</p>

<p>Nat listened with all his ears, but there was
one thing that did not look right about it: The
old man talked about the place and the way to
find it as though there had never been anything
the matter with him at all. If there was something
wrong about his mind, Nat failed to see
what it was. He talked as though he were reading
from a book.</p>

<p>“But what makes you give all this to me?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
said Nat at length. “You don’t act as though
you had any interest in it at all.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to last long, and I know it,”
said Mr. Nickerson. “I have neither kith nor
kin in this land, or in any other so far as I know,
and since Jonas does not want the money, why
you can have it. I know enough about law to
know that there is nobody can take it away from
you. If you could, I say if you could without too
much trouble, call and see Jonas’s wife after you
get the money, and give her one thousand dollars,
I could rest easy. Could you do that much
for me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can. I will give it all to her
if you say so.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you to do that. I know
you would give it all to her, because you are
an honest boy. You have been good to me during
the years I have been here, never had anything
cross to say to me, you don’t like Jonas,
and neither do I. Mandy has been good to me,
too, but you see if I give her this money Jonas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
will have a chance to take it. I don’t want him
to see a cent of it.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Nickerson, what was your object
in pasting your description in the book this way?
The book might have been stolen.”</p>

<p>“But it was not stolen. As many as fifty
soldiers, Union and Confederate, have had that
book in their hands, and when they came to turn
it up and see what the title was, they threw it
aside. No soldier wants to read a book like that.
It is growing late and I must lie down somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Come into my room and turn into my
bunk,” said Nat. “You will sleep well there.”</p>

<p>“Jonas has turned me out of his house and
I am going to stay out,” said Mr. Nickerson,
with more spirit than he usually exhibited. “I
will lie down here and die in his barn.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way, Mr. Nickerson,” said
Nat; and some way or other he could not get it
out of his head that the old man was in earnest.
“If you are going to stay here I will go up and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
get a couple of blankets and a pillow for you.
I will see you all right in the morning.”</p>

<p>He laid the book beside the old man, folded
up the two leaves and put them into his pocket
and hurried toward the house. Somehow he
did not feel exactly right about Mr. Nickerson.

<span class="medium"><i>Jonas Tries to Make Amends.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is hard to tell what Jonas Keeler’s feelings
were as he paced back and forth in
his narrow cabin, his eyes flashing, his
hands clenched and his lips framing to himself
words that he dared not utter aloud. He was
disappointed&mdash;sorely disappointed because Mr.
Nickerson, who knew that he wanted money, that
he thought of nothing else, had presumed to present
him a book for a keepsake. Sometimes
he felt so angry at him that he had half
a mind to go out, find the old man and throw
him over the bars. His wife said nothing for
some minutes, but seeing that Jonas was getting
madder instead of better natured, she ventured
to put in a word or two.</p>

<p>“Father, you didn’t do right in talking to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the old man the way you did,” said she, hardly
knowing how her words would be received.</p>

<p>“The old fool!” hissed Jonas, throwing his
hat into one corner and burying both of his hands
in his hair. “What did he want to give me a
book for when he knows how badly I need money?
I am sorry that I was so good natured with him
afterward.”</p>

<p>“But father, there was something in the
book,” continued Mrs. Keeler, a sudden idea occurring
to her.</p>

<p>Jonas stopped quickly and faced her, a queer
expression on his face.</p>

<p>“There may have been something in the
book that told you where his money was. That
is if he has got any money; which I don’t believe.”</p>

<p>Jonas began to see the matter in a different
light now. He pulled a chair close to his wife’s
side and sat down in it.</p>

<p>“Do you think there was money in the
book?” he almost whispered.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. You threw the book with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
force enough to tear it all to pieces; but there
may have been a paper or something else in the
leaves which told where his money was hidden.
But between you and me, I would not put the
least faith in it.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because the old gentleman is not in his
right mind. You have talked about money,
money and nothing but money ever since he has
been here, and you have finally got him in the
way of believing that he has some.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that. The old
fellow talks plainly enough sometimes, and then
again he rattles on and you can’t make head or
tail of what he says. But I wonder if there was
anything in that book? If there was anything
there, it must have been put in years ago, when
the old man was right in his top story.”</p>

<p>“It would not do any harm for you to find
out. You can tell him that you did not mean
anything by what you had said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That depends upon whether I do or not,”
said Jonas hastily. “I will wait until I see what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
is in that book first. If there is a plan in there
which tells where to go to find the money, but
you say he hasn’t got any, why then I will be
kinder good natured with him; but if there is
nothing there, he can just keep out of my house;
and that’s all there is about it.”</p>

<p>Jonas thought that by this time Mr. Nickerson
had gone to bed, so he went out and started
toward a little lean-to, it could scarcely have
been called any thing better, which was the place
where the old man slept. There were leaks in
the roof and sundry cracks through which the
severe winds could seek entrance, but that was
not the kind of sleeping place Jonas had in the
cabin. There everything was tight, and there
were a few articles of furniture scattered around,
such as a table and chairs and a wash stand. In
place of a shake-down he had a regular bed-stead
and the blankets and quilts on it were abundant
to keep him warm in the coldest weather. It was
dark in the lean-to, but Jonas knew the way. He
groped his way up to the shake-down but there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
was nobody in it. In fact the bed had not been
slept in at all.</p>

<p>“By George! I reckon the old fool took me
at my word,” said Jonas, as he turned toward the
door. “I did not think the fellow had so much
pluck. I wonder where he is!”</p>

<p>He bent his steps this time toward the lean-to
which Nat called his room. It was a little
better than Mr. Nickerson’s and but a very little
better. It was tight but there was no furniture
in it; the dirt floor did duty as chairs and washstand.
Whenever Nat got up in the morning and
desired to perform his ablutions, there was the
branch handy, and it was but little trouble to go
down there. It was dark in here, too, but a
slight feeling among the bed clothes showed Jonas
that somebody had been there. The pillow
was gone, and so were the quilts that Nat usually
spread over him.</p>

<p>“This beats my time all hollow,” said Jonas,
pulling off his hat and wiping his forehead. “If
he should go out among the neighbors&mdash;but then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
he can’t have gone that far. Nat is going to
make him up a bed somewhere.”</p>

<p>Jonas’s next trip was to the barn, and there
he found Mr. Nickerson stretched out on a rude
bed which Nat had made for him, and a lighted
lantern throwing a dim light over the scene.
Jonas first impulse was to find out what had become
of that book. It was there, lying on the
pillow close beside Mr. Nickerson’s head. Nat
was seated on the floor a little ways from him,
but he did not say anything when Jonas came in.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the new-comer, with an attempt
to appear cheerful. “What you laying
down out here for? Why don’t you get up and
go to your own room?”</p>

<p>“You have told me once that I need not come
into your house any more,” said the old man,
in his usual whining tone, “and I am going to
take you at your word. I shall never go into
your house again.”</p>

<p>“Shaw!” said Jonas, with a sorry effort
at a laugh. “You didn’t pay any attention to
what I said, do you? If I had brought your tobacco
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
you would be all right now; but I was
bothered so with a heap of things that happened
while I was down town, that I forgot all about it.
I didn’t mean nothing. Is this the book you were
going to give me for a keepsake!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s the one.”</p>

<p>“What does it say in it?” continued Jonas;
and Nat could see that he was turning over the
leaves very carefully.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to read it all, every word of
it, and perhaps it would have done you some
good.”</p>

<p>“Well, get up and go into the house. The
old woman has got some hot tea left for you, and
you will sleep better there than you will here.
Have you got a programme, or whatever
you call it, so that I can find where your money is
hidden!”</p>

<p>“No, there is nothing of the kind there,”
said Mr. Nickerson, with a movement which
showed plainly that he wished Jonas would go
away. “There is nothing but reading in the
book.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>Jonas was getting angry again. Nat could
see that by the looks of his face.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there is nothing in it?” he
asked, in a voice which trembled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. You can examine it and see
for yourself. I shall not last long&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear no such talk as that.
You will last longer than I will, I bet you. Nat,
have you got any of this book stowed away
about your good clothes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I have not,” answered Nat, rising
to his feet. “You can search me and see.”</p>

<p>Nat was perfectly safe in making this proposition.
We said he had put those two leaves into
his pocket; so he did; but he had taken pains
to conceal them since. In a remote corner of the
barn were some corn huskings which Caleb had
left there as he was working at the grain to be
taken to the mill. Underneath that pile were
the two leaves that Jonas wanted to find.</p>

<p>“That’s the way you always serve me when
you think I have got anything you want,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Nat boldly. “You took a quarter away from
me that I had left after buying my shoes, and
I haven’t seen it since.”</p>

<p>“Of course I did. It was the properest
thing that I should have the handling of all your
money; but any more such talk as that will bring
the switch down on your shoulders in good shape.
You hear me? There’s nothing but reading in
this book, you say old man?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, and you would not have it when
I offered it to you. I gave you a thousand dollars
which you promised&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw! shut up about that,” said Jonas, rising
to his feet; for in order to hold conversation
with Mr. Nickerson he had kneeled down by his
side. “There’s nothing in here that tells about
the money?”</p>

<p>“No, no, there is nothing of that kind, I
have not got any money. I am a poor, feeble old
man and shall not last long&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will bet you won’t,” roared Jonas, livid
with rage and shaking his fist in the old man’s
face. “You won’t get a bite of anything to eat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
until you tell me where that money is; you hear
me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect it; I never have expected it.
I shall die before morning&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jonas did not wait to hear any more, nor did
he say anything further about Mr. Nickerson
getting up and going to his own room. He did
stop long enough to throw the book at Nat, but
Nat was on the alert and the missive did not
touch him. It ruined the book so far as reading
was concerned. The remaining leaves were torn
out of it and scattered all over the floor, and it
was useless for anybody to think of putting them
together again.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, he has gone at last,” said
Mr. Nickerson, with a long drawn sigh of relief.
“I expected he would come here.”</p>

<p>“So did I; and I took my leaves and hid
them under this pile of corn,” said Nat. “Now
I wish there was something else that I could do
for you.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing, nothing. I shall not be
here much longer to bother him, but he will think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of me when I am gone. Nat, you must try to get
that money. Don’t you let anybody see that
paper. Hide it carefully so that no one can find
it. Good night. I want to sleep now. Come in
in the morning and see me.”</p>

<p>“I will do it,” said Nat getting upon his
feet and shaking the old man cordially by the
hand. “I shall not wait until morning, either.
You may want something or other during the
night.”</p>

<p>Nat went away feeling heavy hearted over
what had just occurred. Something, he did not
know what told him that the old man would
never live to see the sun rise again. He felt
guilty in going away from him, but Mr. Nickerson
had requested it and he did not see what
else there was to be done.</p>

<p>“I won’t take my clothes off at all when I
lie down,” said Nat, going into his lean-to and
shutting the door behind him. “And to think
that I am rich and going to be rich through his
death! I wish the old man was in perfect health
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and was going off with me. I would make his
life be as peaceable as I knew how.”</p>

<p>Nat’s brain was so upset with all that had
happened that he could not think very readily,
but he did not ponder upon anything so much
as he did upon what the old gentleman had said
to Jonas: “I shall die before morning.” That
was bringing the matter pretty close to him, and
he resolved that he would not go to sleep at all;
but his work with the potatoes had wearied him,
and almost before he knew it he was in the land
of dreams. He awoke with a start and it was
broad day-light. To roll off his shake-down,
seize his hat and make his way to the barn was
the work of a very few minutes. Everything
seemed quiet and still there. With cautious
haste he opened the door and saw Mr. Nickerson
lying on his shake-down just as he left him the
night before. He wanted to say something to
him but he did not dare. He drew a step closer
and one look was enough. With frantic speed he
ran to the house, pushed open the door and seized
Jonas by the shoulder.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>“Wake up, here,” he said, in a trembling
voice. “The old man has bothered you for the
last time. He is dead.”</p>

<p>Jonas was a sound sleeper and it was a hard
task to awaken him; but there was something so
thrilling in Nat’s words that he was on his feet
in an instant. He looked at the boy as though he
did not know what he meant.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nickerson lies dead down in your
barn,” said Nat, earnestly. “He told you last
night that he would die before morning, and sure
enough he has.”</p>

<p>“Why-I-You don’t mean it!” exclaimed
Jonas, his eyes wide with excitement.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to talk, Jonas,” said Mrs. Keeler
nervously. “Did you see him, Nat?”</p>

<p>“I have just come from there.”</p>

<p>“Then go along and see if you can do something,”
urged his wife. “Maybe he ain’t dead.”</p>

<p>Jonas had by this time hurriedly put his
clothes on, and he led the way to the barn with
top speed, stopping only to call Caleb on the way.
Everything was as Nat had left it the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
before. There was “Baxter’s Saints’ Rest”
with the leaves all torn out of it, lying by the dead
man’s head, and it seemed as though the old man
had not moved a finger since Nat bade him good
night.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he has gone up,” said Jonas;
and Nat looked to see some little twinge of remorse
in his tones. But there was not a particle
that he could see, not even an expression of regret.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is gone, and now what remains for
us to do? We can’t let him lie here,” said Nat,
as he looked at the withered form of the old man.</p>

<p>“Say, Nat, don’t you say any thing about
his being out here where the neighbors can hear
it,” said Jonas, with a scowl, pulling Nat up close
to him and whispering the words in his ear. “If
you do, remember that switch.”</p>

<p>“I am not at all afraid of your whipping
me,” said Nat, wrenching his arm out of Jonas’s
grasp. “You have done that for the last time.
You had better make arrangements to do something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
with Mr. Nickerson’s body, if you are going
to.”</p>

<p>Jonas stood and looked at Nat as if he could
scarcely believe his ears. The rebellion, which
he had been working up for so long, had come
suddenly and promptly, too, and the man was
afraid of it. What was Nat going to do? There
was but one thing that came up in Jonas’ mind
and that was money. It dawned upon him that
Mr. Nickerson had possibly taken the boy into
his confidence and Jonas saw that if such were
the case he must keep quiet in order to find out
what it was.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to harm you, Natty,” said he,
but his looks certainly belied him, “but you can
see for yourself how the neighbors will talk if
they find out that the old man had been sleeping
in my barn.”</p>

<p>“I understand all about that,” said Nat.
“You need not fear of my saying any thing. You
had better shut up Caleb’s mouth if you want the
thing kept secret.”</p>

<p>Jonas evidently thought so too. He took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Caleb off on one side and held a very earnest conversation
with him, and after this, with Mrs.
Keeler’s help, who came down to the barn as
soon as she was fairly dressed, they made out to
carry the old man’s body up to the house and lay
it on Jonas’s bed. Nobody passed along the
road while they were doing it. When the neighbors
came there they would think that Mr. Nickerson
had died in that room; they would not
think of the barn at all. When this much had
been done Nat was sent off post haste on a mule
for the doctor, and Caleb was commanded to go
around to those who lived close by and tell them
of the bereavement that had come upon the house
of Jonas Keeler during the night. After that
Jonas seated himself upon a chair in the cabin,
folded his arms, dropped his chin upon his breast
and waited for the neighbors to come.</p>

<p>After that each one had his particular duties
to perform, though the neighbors did the most of
it. Jonas was too weak and dispirited to do any
thing, even to doing the chores, and left it all to
Caleb, who went about wondering if the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
man’s taking off was going to work any change
in his circumstances. Nat’s first care was to
find the two leaves that were pasted together and
hide them where there was no possibility of any
body’s hunting them out. Then he settled down
to think about his future. Mr. Nickerson was
gone, and what had he to keep him longer under
Jonas’s roof? He had seventy-five dollars in
money, he had kept a strict account of that, and
what was there to hinder him from going down
to Manchester and making an effort to enrich
himself? It required long study, but by the time
the funeral was over Nat had decided upon his
course.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Nat Sees a Friend.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“There’s</span> just this much about it,” said
Nat, when Mr. Nickerson had been laid
away in a little grove of evergreens behind
the barn, and the neighbors had gone home
one after the other and the family had returned
to the house, “it is going to be something of a
job for me to go down there and get that money.
In the first place there is Jonas, who will be furious
when he finds that I have run away from
home, especially if he thinks I am going to make
something by it. He will follow me night and
day, and I can’t make a move of any sort without
he will see it. Then he will bring me home and
won’t I ketch it, though?”</p>

<p>This bothered Nat more than any thing else.
He wanted some little time to think seriously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
about the way to beat Jonas at his own game, and
went into the barn, drew a milk-stool to the
threshold so that he could see anybody that approached
him from the house and sat down to go
over the points again.</p>

<p>“I have got to have help,” thought Nat,
“and there is only one boy in the settlement that
I can trust; and when it comes to that, I can’t
trust him, either. He is a lazy, good-for-nothing
fellow, and worse than all, I dare not tell him
what I am looking after. I must go it alone if I
can; but if I find that I can’t do it, I must see
Peleg Graves about it.”</p>

<p>Come to look at the matter Nat was in bad
straits, and that was a fact. Of course there
were plenty of boys he could have got to assist
him, but the trouble was he did not know any of
them. He and Caleb were much alike in this respect.
The families around them were a little
better off than they were, nobody liked Jonas on
account of his shiftless ways, and his boys, Nat
and Caleb, had been brought up to follow very
much in his footsteps, and his bad example had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
deteriorating effect on their character&mdash;they were
like dogs without a master. That was the way
Nat looked at it, and it was the source of infinite
annoyance to him.</p>

<p>“Whenever I go down town I can just go
alone,” Nat had often said to himself. “All the
boys there have their friends who are glad to see
them. It is ‘Hello, Jim!’ or ‘Hello, Tom!’ here
and there and everywhere; but if any one looks at
me he seems to say: ‘What you doing here, Nat?
You have not any business to come to town.’
And I have more money to spend than any of
them. But Peleg has never been that way. He
has always seemed glad to see me, but I think the
candy I was eating had something to do with it.”</p>

<p>After long reflection Nat finally made up his
mind that he would call upon Peleg and see what
he had to say about it; but there was
one thing on which he was fully resolved: He
would not let Peleg know what they were searching
for until they found the money. He was not
going to stay about Jonas’s house any longer&mdash;that
was another thing that he had decided upon;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
and something happened just then to make him
adhere to this decision. The door of the house
opened at this point in his meditations and Caleb
came out. Of course he was very solemn, almost
any body would be if one had died so near him,
but he came along toward Nat as if he had something
on his mind.</p>

<p>“Well, Nat, your friend has gone at last,”
said he, by way of beginning the conversation.</p>

<p>“That is a fact. He was the only friend I
had about the house.”</p>

<p>“You will not have any more money to buy
tobacco for him, will you?” asked Caleb. “What
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“How did I get any money to buy any tobacco
for him?” inquired Nat. That was just
what Nat had been doing for a number of years,
but how did Caleb find it out?</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t fool me,” said Caleb, with a
laugh. “I saw him go into the fence corner the
day before he died and take a plug of tobacco out
of there. I did not say any thing to pap about it,
for I did not know but it was some secret business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
that you and old man Nickerson had. I did
not want to go back on you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If he found any tobacco there he must have
got it himself,” said Nat, for he did not care to
listen any more to the falsehoods Caleb was about
to utter. “I don’t know any thing about it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, now, what is the use of fooling in that
way? I would like to know how Mr. Nickerson
could have got any tobacco for himself. He has
not been to town in two years to my certain
knowledge. You got it the last time you were
there and stowed it away where he could find it.”</p>

<p>Nat was amazed at this revelation. In spite
of all his cunning Caleb had succeeded in getting
upon his secret at last. If the latter told his
father of it he would feel the switch sure enough;
that is if he stayed about the premises. Without
making any reply he picked up his stool, moved
it back where it belonged and made ready to
walk out of the barn.</p>

<p>“You see I am on to those little tricks of
yours,” said Caleb. “Don’t go yet for I have
something to say to you. Now I will tell you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
this to begin with, Nat Wood: You know where
Mr. Nickerson had the rest of that money hidden.”</p>

<p>“What money?” asked Nat, innocently.</p>

<p>“The money he had hidden when he came
here,” Caleb almost shouted, doubling up his fists
as though he had more than half a mind to strike
Nat for professing so much ignorance. “Pap
says you know where it is and he is going to have
it out of you, too.”</p>

<p>“I will bet you he don’t,” said Nat to himself.
“That money is mine and if I don’t have
it, it can stay there until it rots.”</p>

<p>“Now I will tell you what we will do, Nat,”
continued Caleb, dropping his threatening manner
and laying his hand patronizingly on Nat’s
shoulder. “Me and you will keep this still from
pap, and go down to Manchester and dig up that
money. Oh man alive, won’t we live high&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You seem to think it, if there is any of it at
all, is in the ground,” interrupted Nat.</p>

<p>“Where else should it be put? If it is in the
ground no one can stumble on it while he is roaming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
around through the woods. I will go with
you and will start now, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are going down to Manchester
to look for that money, which I don’t believe is
there, you can go,” said Nat. “But I will stay
here. I am not going to dig around unless I can
make something by it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on now, Nat,” said Caleb, coaxingly.
“You know where it is and I will bet on
it.”</p>

<p>“If you do bet on it you will lose whatever
you bet. But I have already had my say. I
won’t go down to Manchester with you.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t go I will tell pap,” said Caleb,
growing angry again.</p>

<p>“You can run and tell him as soon as you
please. If I could see the money sticking up before
me this minute I would not give you a cent
of it. It does not belong to you.”</p>

<p>“Then I bet you I am going to tell pap,”
said Caleb, who was so nearly beside himself that
he walked up and down the barn swinging his
hands about his head. “You will get that switch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
over your shoulders before you go to bed tonight.
Whoop-pe! I would not have the licking
you will get for anything.”</p>

<p>Caleb marched away as if he were afraid he
would forget his errand before he got to the
house, and Nat leaned against the door-post and
watched him. There was one good reason why
Caleb would not tell his father of the tobacco hidden
in the fence corner, and that was the fear that
the switch would be used upon himself. Why
had he not told his father of it when he came from
town? Jonas was in just the right mood to use
that switch then, and he would have beaten Nat
most unmercifully until he got at the full history
of the tobacco money. But Caleb had let it go
for three days now, and perhaps Jonas felt differently
about it. Nat did not know this. He
stood there in the door of the barn waiting for
Jonas to come, but he waited in vain. Nat was
doing some heavy thinking in the meantime, and
he finally concluded that he would go and see
Peleg and have the matter settled before he went
any further. With a parting glance at the house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
he put the bushes that lined the potato patch between
them, broke into a run and in a quarter of
an hour he was at Peleg’s barn. Peleg was there.
He was engaged in getting some corn ready to go
to the mill and he was husking it.</p>

<p>“Well, Nat, where are you going to find another
friend like Mr. Nickerson was to you?” was
the way he greeted Nat when he came into the
barn.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Nat’s reply. “I am
left alone in the world. There is nobody who
cares a cent whether I live or die.”</p>

<p>When Peleg saw what humor Nat was in,
how solemn he talked about the loss of his friend,
he faced about on his seat and looked at him.
Any boy who had been in Nat’s place would have
been satisfied that Peleg could not be trusted, and
would have turned away from him to look elsewhere
for a friend. He was not a bad looking
boy, but he had a kind of sneaking, hang-dog
way with him that did not go far toward making
his friends. But he had friends and that was the
worst of it. It was a sort of policy with Peleg to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
agree to every thing that any body said to him.
He did that with an object, and Nat always
thought that he listened with the intention of
learning something. Perhaps if we follow him
closely we shall see how nearly he drew Nat on
to tell him all about the money and the plans he
had laid for obtaining possession of it.</p>

<p>“‘Shaw! I would not talk that way,” said
Peleg, throwing an ear of corn into the pile.
“You have got friends enough here. There is
Caleb and Jonas&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t know what sort of
friends they are to me,” Nat interposed.</p>

<p>“Well, between I and you, I have often
thought that they might have used you a little better,”
said Peleg, sinking his voice almost to a
whisper. “Jonas uses that switch on you most
too much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he has done that for the last time.
I am not going to stand it any longer.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do&mdash;run away from
home?”</p>

<p>“I am going to run away from Jonas. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
don’t call that my home&mdash;I never had one; but I
want to get away and make my own living.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, my boy; that’s right. You
will make a better living than you do there. Look
at the clothes you wear!”</p>

<p>“I will have better before long,” said Nat,
crossing one leg over the other when he saw that
Peleg was looking steadily at the huge rent in his
overalls.</p>

<p>“Say,” whispered Peleg, getting upon his
feet and approaching his face close to Nat’s.
“Did old Nickerson leave you any money? You
need not be afraid to talk to me about that,” he
continued, seeing that Nat looked down at the
ground and hesitated. “They say that the old
man was, or had been, powerful rich, and if he
was a friend to any body in that house he ought
to be to you.”</p>

<p>“I know he was my friend. He always had
something kind to say to me.”</p>

<p>“I knew it; I knew it all the time. Say!
Jonas has not used up all that thousand dollars
that the old man gave him?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” asked Nat,
in surprise. “Has Jonas been talking about it?”</p>

<p>“I won’t say that he has or that he hasn’t,”
said Peleg, with a knowing shake of his head. “I
don’t mind telling you, for I know it won’t go
any further, that I have heard something about
it. You would not expect me to say more without
breaking my word, and that is something I
never do. But I tell you that he has got a heap of
that thousand dollars left.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I have often thought. Where
has he got it hidden?”</p>

<p>“That’s another thing I must not tell you,
but I know where, or at least I can come within
a thousand miles of it, where he hides it. You
see I know a heap of things that people don’t
think I do. If you should tell me that you know
where that money is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I don’t,” said Nat. “I know where
some of it is&mdash;that is the most of his fortune is
concealed.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” said Peleg while a smile, a very
faint smile which nobody would have noticed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
overspread his face. He did not give utterance
to this expression but said it to himself, while
Nat himself, always on the lookout for some such
signs, did not know how extremely delighted he
was by it. Peleg was in a fair way to learn all
about it. “If you should tell me where this
money is hidden,” he went on after controlling
himself, “I would die before any one should find
out from me the exact spot. You see the way the
thing works with me is this: If a person tells
you a secret, that is yours to keep. Don’t tell
any body of it; and in a very short time people
will learn that you can be trusted.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just where this money is,”
said Nat, and he hesitated a long while before
he said the next words. “I know where the papers
are.”</p>

<p>“What papers!”</p>

<p>“The papers that tell where the money is
hidden.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“I have got them safe and I should like to
see any body find them.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>“That’s right; keep them safe,” said Peleg,
although he was much disappointed because the
papers were not instantly produced. “Don’t you
let a living soul into it unless you find some one
to tell the secret to.”</p>

<p>“I am going down to look those papers up
now,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Down where?”</p>

<p>“Down to Manchester,” replied Nat; whereupon
that same smile came upon Peleg’s face
once more. He was thinking how he was going
to work to get a sight at those papers.</p>

<p>“It is going to be no easy task to go down
there and find the papers all by myself,” continued
Nat, walking back and forth across the floor
and wondering how in the world he was going to
propose the matter to Peleg. “You see the minute
I go away Jonas will suspect something, and
if there is any point he will go for it will be Manchester.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” said Peleg, a bright idea
striking him. “And if he found you there your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
chance of digging up the papers would be up
stump. When do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“I would go now, this very night, if I had
some one to go with me. I would find the money,
if there is any, and go away where I am not
known.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I would do,” replied
Peleg, with sundry motions of his head which he
thought added emphasis to his words. “Then
nobody can ask you where you got so many
stamps.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fear for that,” said Nat, hastily.
“I want everybody to know where I got them. I
will get away and put them in the bank; then I
should like to see any body get hold of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea. When you once get it into
the bank it is safe. You say you want somebody
to help you. That shows you are wise. If there
is any body on top of this broad earth who will
be up to tricks, it is that Jonas Keeler.”</p>

<p>“There is Caleb,” suggested Nat. “He
won’t come out where any body can see him, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
he will sneak around in the bushes. Jonas and
Caleb will go together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Caleb,” said Peleg, contemptuously.
“Caleb is a fellow to be&mdash;Well, I reckon we
would best look out for him too,” he added, for it
suddenly occurred to him that the more persons
Nat had against him the greater need he would
have for somebody to protect him. “If there is
any body can get away with Caleb, I am the one.
There ain’t any scheme that boy is up to that I
can’t see through. I will go halvers with you on
that money, or rather the papers that will tell
where it is hidden, when we get it.”</p>

<p>“Then you and I can’t hitch,” replied Nat,
surprised at the proposition. “I can not pay any
such sum as that.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Peleg. “You are
going to make as much as three or four thousand
dollars by it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I will make and I don’t
care. It will be enough to take me away from the
house in which I now live, and that is all I want.
I might as well go home.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>“Well, what will you give? Maybe you
think it is fun to go down there and beat Jonas
and Caleb when they are trying to get the money
or the papers away from you? I shall want good
pay for doing that.”</p>

<p>“I will give you good pay; more than double
what you can make here. I will give you a dollar
a day, payment to begin when we strike Manchester.”</p>

<p>It was now Peleg’s turn to be astonished.
He stared hard at Nat to see if he was in earnest,
and then went back to his seat and began husking
corn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Mr. Graves Is Astonished</i>.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> were two very badly disappointed
boys in Peleg Graves’s barn that day, and
each one thought that he had good
grounds for it.</p>

<p>“The little fule!” said Peleg, spitefully
snatching up an ear of com which happened to
be nearest to him. “Here he is, almost rolling in
wealth, and he won’t go halvers with me on that
money. A dollar a day! Well, that is more than
I could get for shucking corn or digging potatoes
these times, and now Peleg, I want to ask you a
question: Did you make a mistake there? I
reckon you did. Suppose he makes a go of it and
finds the papers&mdash;‘Shaw! I can see through a
ladder as plain as he can. The papers are the
money; that’s what’s the matter. And suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
he finds it with my help, what is there to hinder
me from getting up some dark night and taking
the money&mdash;Whoop-pee! Why did not I think
of that?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I may as well go home, and I am
sorry that I ever came up here,” said Nat to himself,
as he walked listlessly about the barn floor.
“I have put Peleg on his guard now, and he will
make another one that I will have to fight in order
to get that money. Peleg would go halvers with
me on that money! I will give him a dollar a day
and that is every cent I will give him.”</p>

<p>“Are you off, Nat?” inquired Peleg, facing
around on his stool again.</p>

<p>“Yes, I might as well,” replied Nat, who
had started for home. “You want altogether too
much for helping me.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, hold on. Don’t go yet. Maybe
you and I can come to some understanding. You
don’t think it is worth while to watch Jonas and
Caleb, but I tell you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. But supposing I don’t find the
money? Then I can’t pay you a thing.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Peleg, for the thought was
new to him. “I did not think of that. Now see
here; I will tell you how we will fix this thing.
You want me to stay with you until you find the
money, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Well, you give me a dollar a day&mdash;But hold
on. Have you got any money at all? I had better
know that before we start.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have as much as&mdash;as ten dollars,
and I will give you your pay every night.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get ten dollars?” asked
Peleg, who was very much surprised. “Why
don’t you buy a new pair of overalls?”</p>

<p>“I have my reasons. They are good ones,
too. Are you going with me or ain’t you? We
have some other little matters to decide, and it is
getting along toward dark.”</p>

<p>“If you say so we will go tonight,” replied
Peleg, getting upon his feet again.</p>

<p>“What will you say to your folks?”</p>

<p>“I will tell them that I am going out after
the cows, or any thing else that I think of. My
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
folks won’t trouble us, I will bet on that. But
we have got to have something to eat.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that, and I can buy everything
we want in Manchester&mdash;every thing except
the meat. You have a gun&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes; but we must get some powder and
shot for that. I am all out.”</p>

<p>“We can do that, too. Now I will tell you
what I have decided upon.”</p>

<p>The two boys drew closer together and for
fifteen minutes there was some whispering done
between them. At the end of that time it was all
over and the boys departed satisfied&mdash;at least one
of them was.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I made a mistake in coming
here at all,” was what Nat said to himself. “I
ought to have gone on and done the best I could
by myself. Peleg is up to something and he will
bear watching. Do you suppose he means to run
down and tell Jonas about my running away?”</p>

<p>This thought created consternation in Nat’s
mind and he faced about and looked at the barn
in which he had left Peleg. But if the truth must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
be told, Peleg had no intention of going near
Jonas. He was too sharp to throw away the easy
means he had of making a fortune by doing that.
When Nat went away he leaned against the hay-mow,
or rather the place where it would have
been if there had been any hay there, and broke
into a silent but hearty fit of merriment.</p>

<p>“Peleg, the thing you have often wanted has
come to you at last,” he whispered, walking to
the door and peeping slyly out to see if Nat had
really gone. “Your fortune has come to you at
last. Now what be I going to do; for I must get
away from here as soon as it comes dark. In the
first place I will go in and tell pap about it.”</p>

<p>Peleg hurried to the house without taking
pains to shut the barn door, and broke into the
living room where his father and mother were
sitting engaged in smoking. This was the way
in which they always passed their time when
they could find nothing better to do, and that
happened very frequently.</p>

<p>“Have you got that corn all shucked?” inquired
his father.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>“Naw; and what’s more, I ain’t a-going to
shuck no more to-night,” replied Peleg.</p>

<p>“What’s to do now?”</p>

<p>“Well I will tell you,” said Peleg, drawing
a chair without any back close in front of the fire.
“I have got a chance to make a fortune; but if I
tell you what it is you must go halvers with me,
or I shan’t tell you a thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves and his wife were both amazed.
They took their pipes from their mouths, straightened
up and looked hard at Peleg to see if he
were in earnest.</p>

<p>“You remember old man Nickerson, I
reckon, don’t you?” continued Peleg. “Well,
he’s gone dead, you know, and he has willed a
whole pile of money, or papers and such things
which shows where the money is, and Nat wants
me to go down to Manchester with him and help
dig it up.”</p>

<p>“Who teld you about this?” demanded Mr.
Graves.</p>

<p>“Nat was here not two minutes ago and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
told me himself. He’s going as soon as it comes
dark.”</p>

<p>“Now the best thing you can do is to run
over and tell Jonas about it,” said Mr. Graves,
knocking the ashes from his pipe and getting
upon his feet. “The idea of that little snipe having
a whole pile of money&mdash;it is not to be thought
of.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just ain’t a-going to say a word to
Jonas about it,” said Peleg. “They isn’t any
body knows about that money excepting you and
me. I am going to have it all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves looked hard at his son again and
finally took his chair once more. He saw in a
moment what Peleg was up to, but he wanted to
hear the whole plan.</p>

<p>“What you going to do? How be I going to
help you?”</p>

<p>It did not take Peleg many minutes to make
his father understand what he had decided to do,
and in fact there was not much for him to explain.
He was going to get his gun and go over to Nat’s
house and wait until he was ready. When he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
came out he was going to join him, and together
they would go to Manchester and camp out until
they found the papers which would tell them
where the money was concealed. After that was
done he would be ready to begin operations. Mr.
Graves might blacken up his face to resemble a
negro, come up and overpower them and take the
money, or he might watch his opportunity and
approach the camp while the two boys were away
buying provisions.</p>

<p>“Who told you about this?” said Mr.
Graves, who was lost in admiration of Peleg’s
cunning. It sounded like some novel that he used
to read in his schoolboy days.</p>

<p>“Nobody didn’t tell me of it,” said Peleg.
“I got it all up out of my own head. Don’t you
think it will work?”</p>

<p>“Of course it will. How long are you going
to stay down to Manchester?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask him about that; probably not
more’n three or four days.”</p>

<p>“But you have got to live while you are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
looking for the papers. Have you got any thing
cooked, S’manthy?”</p>

<p>“That’s taken care of, for Nat is going to
support us. He has as much as ten dollars that
he is going&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where did he get ten dollars? It looks to
me as though that boy has been stealing.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t old man Nickerson have given
him that sum while he was alive? That boy has
come honestly by his money, and, look here, pap,
don’t you fool yourself. If Nat has got ten dollars
he has got twenty dollars; and don’t you forget
it.”</p>

<p>“Do you reckon that old man Nickerson gave
him all that money?” said Mr. Graves, who was
profoundly astonished at Nat’s wealth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where else he could have got
it. Now I want some clothes to take with me and
my gun. What be you going to do, pap, when we
find that money?”</p>

<p>“You have got to find the papers first.”</p>

<p>“Now just listen at you,” said Peleg, with
evident disgust. “There ain’t no papers there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
When we find the place where the thing is hidden,
it will be money, and nothing else. Nat ain’t got
no papers. You hear me?”</p>

<p>“Then I reckon I had best wait a while until
I see you again,” said Mr. Graves, reflectively.
“If you find the money I want to take it all.”</p>

<p>“How much will that be, Peleg?” said the
woman, who had been so surprised at this conversation
that she had taken no part in it. “It will
be as much as three or four hundred dollars,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Three or four hundred fiddle-sticks!” said
Peleg. “Old man Nickerson was worth a power
of money, and if he has got any hidden it all
amounts to three or four thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Good lands!” gasped Mrs. Graves, settling
back in her chair. “I can have some good clothes
with that. Three or four thousand! I reckon I’d
best fill up for another smoke.”</p>

<p>Peleg began to stir about and in a short time
he had collected his wardrobe, which did not
amount to much seeing that he carried the whole
of it in an old valise, and his gun that was going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
to furnish them with game while they were looking
for the money. It was about as worthless a
thing as ever was fashioned in wood and iron, but
still it managed to bring down a squirrel or rabbit
every time Peleg went hunting.</p>

<p>“Now if any body comes here and wants to
know where I am, you can tell him that you don’t
know,” said Peleg, as he slung his bundle on his
single barrel and put the whole on his shoulder.
“You had better come down that way to-morrow,
pap, but let me tell you one thing: You had better
keep out of sight. If Nat so much as suspects
that there is somebody watching us, he will quit
the work right then and there, and we shan’t find
any money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves said that he would take abundant
care of that, and Peleg opened the door and went
out. There was no “good-by” about it. As soon
as he was gone Mr. Graves proceeded to fill up
for another smoke.</p>

<p>“That there is a powerful good boy who has
just went out,” said he. “What on earth should
we do without him? I tell you, S’manthy, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
are going to be wonderful rich in a few days
from now. I know of three or four horses that I
want&mdash;”</p>

<p>With this introduction Mr. Graves went on
to enumerate the various horses and cows and
farming utensils he needed and must have to
make his calling as agriculturist successful, and
when he got through his wife took up the strain,
and by the time that twelve o’clock came they
had not only three or four thousand dollars of
Mr. Nickerson’s money laid out, but they had
some more thousands besides. It is hard to tell
what they did not provide for. They had a new
house built up, the weeds all cut down, an orchard
in full bearing where the worthless brier patch
used to stand, and every thing fixed up in first-class
shape. But they got tired of this after a
while, and went to bed.</p>

<p>“Pe-leg!” shouted Mr. Graves, when he
awoke at daylight. “It is high time you was up.
Well, now, what am I calling him for? He is a
long way from here by this time, and, S’manthy,
perhaps he has got onto that money after all.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“He could not have found it before he got
where it was,” suggested Mrs. Graves. “He
must camp out some time, else why did he take his
gun with him?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Mr. Graves, after thinking
a moment. “I don’t feel like myself at all
this morning; do you, S’manthy? Now I have
got to get up and build the fire; but I don’t mind
that. In a little while we’ll have somebody to
build it for us. Who’s that coming there?” added
Mr. Graves, who, as he drew on his trousers,
went to the window and glanced up and down
the road. “If there ain’t Jonas I am a Dutchman.
He wants to see what has become of Nat.”</p>

<p>“You won’t tell him, of course?” said his
wife.</p>

<p>“Mighty clear of me. I don’t know where
he is and neither do you.”</p>

<p>The silence that followed on the inside of
the cabin was broken at last by the hasty crunch
of earth and stones outside the door, and then
Jonas laid his heavy hand upon it.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” shouted Mr. Graves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>“It is me; don’t you know Jonas?” answered
a voice. “Get up here. I want to ask you
a question.”</p>

<p>“All right. I will soon be there. Now, old
woman, you cover up and don’t open your head
while he is here.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Graves opened the
door and the two men greeted each other cordially.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Jonas. What started you out so
early? How’s all your family?”</p>

<p>“My family is all right, but I am just now
hunting for that boy, Nat. Ain’t seen anything
of him, have you?”</p>

<p>“Nat? No; has he run away?” asked Mr.
Graves, accidentally letting out the very thing
which he was afraid his wife would mention to
Jonas if she were allowed to talk. “I mean&mdash;you
have been using that switch on him lately,”
he hastily added, after he had caught his breath.</p>

<p>“No, I hadn’t, but I wish I had,” declared
Jonas, for the idea of Nat’s running away was
the very thing that was uppermost in his mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
“I have used that boy altogether too well; and
now that old man Nickerson has gone, he has
cleared out.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, what does the fule boy want to
run away for?” said Mr. Graves, looking down
at the ground. “He will want some money, if he
is going to do that.”</p>

<p>“He has plenty of it, or thinks he has,” said
Jonas, angrily. “You ain’t seen Peleg around
here lately, have you?”</p>

<p>“Peleg? No, he has gone out after the
cows,” said Mr. Graves; and a moment later, as
if to show how very much mistaken he was, one
of the cows in the barnyard set up a prolonged
lowing as if to inquire why somebody did not
come out and milk her. “I declare, there’s the
cows already,” added Mr. Graves, not at all
abashed. “That boy is around here somewhere.
Pe-leg,” he shouted, looking around as though
he expected Peleg to appear.</p>

<p>“You needn’t call to him that way, pap,
‘cause he ain’t there,” said Mrs. Graves under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the bed clothes. “Didn’t you hear him say that
he was going fishing to-day?”</p>

<p>“That’s so; so I did. What do you want of
Peleg, Jonas?”</p>

<p>“I just wanted to know if he could tell me
where Nat was; but if he ain’t here, of course he
can’t tell me. You’re sure he ain’t gone to Manchester
along with Nat?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Graves, as if he were surprised
to hear it. “What does he want to go
down to Manchester for? If he don’t come home
pretty soon I will go after him.”</p>

<p>“Nat has got an idea that there is some
money down there, and he has gone after it. If
he only knew it, I have got all the money that was
there long ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves was really surprised now.</p>

<p>“The old man did not have but a thousand
dollars, and he gave that to me to spend for him,”
said Jonas. “When that boy gets through looking
I hope he will come back.”</p>

<p>The speaker went away without saying another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
word, and Mr. Graves stood in his door
and watched him go. If Jonas told the truth
Peleg had his journey for nothing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>The Storekeeper Speaks</i>.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Very</span> different were Nat Wood’s feelings as
he walked slowly toward the place he
called home. He was certain that during
the last hour of his life he had made a bad mistake
in that he yielded to his first impulse and
took Peleg into his confidence. But the thing
had been done, Peleg knew that the money was
there, or somewhere about Manchester, and now
he had to watch his corners very closely in order
to succeed at all.</p>

<p>“There is one thing about it,” said Nat, as
he went up behind the bushes which stood between
the potato patch and the house. “I will
keep a close watch of Peleg, and if I have any
reason to suppose that he is working for himself,
I will lead him off the track and go somewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
else. Peleg is a pretty sharp boy, but I don’t
believe he can get ahead of me.”</p>

<p>While Nat was thinking this matter over he
drew up behind the bushes and took a long and
earnest survey of the house. There was no one
stirring around it. Having made sure that no
one was watching him Nat hurried to a fence
corner, not the one that Mr. Nickerson went to in
order to get his plug of tobacco, but another one
that lay further off, and after a few minutes’
search arose to his feet with two articles in his
hand which he hastily crammed into his pocket.
One was a roll of money&mdash;he did not look it over
for he knew how much there was in it&mdash;and the
other was the two leaves of “Baxters’ Saints’
Rest,” still pasted together, which told him where
the money was concealed. The money was what
he had left from the sum Mr. Nickerson had last
given him for the purchase of tobacco.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what is the need of my taking
these two leaves with me,” said Nat, as he pushed
the remnants of the twigs and bushes back to the
place which they had occupied before. “Peleg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
might find it and then know as much about the
money as I do. I reckon I had best get that in my
head and then destroy the leaves.”</p>

<p>To think with Nat was to act. He produced
the two leaves from his pocket, seated himself upon
the ground and tore them open. The stray
leaf, the one on which the diagram that showed
where the money was concealed, fell out; and although
it was pretty dark so that he could barely
trace the lines, they were made with a heavy lead
pencil, and furthermore there were but two lines
on the page. The first led from a pile of rubbish&mdash;Nat
did not know what else to call it; it probably
intended to represent the ruins of Mr. Nickerson’s
house&mdash;to a second pile of rubbish, which
was doubtless intended to show the pile of briers.
The second line ran across a little wavering
stream which was intended to stand for the brook,
up to another pile, and there it stopped. If Nat
could only find that pile, his fortune was secure.</p>

<p>It did not take Nat long to make himself master
of this diagram, and hastily putting the leaves
back again, he buried them in the hole from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
which he had taken them out, smoothing over the
leaves so that no one would suspect that anybody
had been there.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” said Nat, with a long-drawn
sigh of relief. “I don’t believe that either
Jonas or Caleb will find them there. Now the
next thing is something else.”</p>

<p>It was to separate ten dollars from his roll of
bills so that he could show them to Peleg when
he came to pay for the various things at Manchester.
If he showed more than that amount
something would be added to Peleg’s suspicions,
and no doubt it would lead to an open rupture.
The rest of the bills he stowed away in his hat,
pressing them down tightly between the outside
and the lining, and holding them there by means
of a pin which he took from his sleeve. His work
was all done now, and he was ready to meet Peleg
as soon as he put in an appearance. But in order
to make sure that he had not been watched Nat
drew along the fence corner into the bushes, until
he came within sight of the house again. There
was no one there, and no one in the barn, either;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
so he concluded that he had done this part of his
work without being seen.</p>

<p>“If I can get through with the rest without
having some one to see me, I shall be glad of it,”
said Nat, going past the house and out to the
bars. “Good-by, old home, for it is the only
home I have had since I can remember. I hope
some day to have a place that I can call my own.”</p>

<p>His soliloquy was interrupted by the appearance
of a person on the road who moved and
acted in a way that showed him that the time for
operations had come. It was Peleg. He carried
his single barrel over his shoulder, supporting an
old-fashioned valise which contained his change
of underwear.</p>

<p>“Well, I am all ready,” said Peleg, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Why, you have not taken a thing with
you,” said Peleg, when he looked around to see
Nat pick up something. “Are you going to come
back here after your clothes?”</p>

<p>“All the clothes I have in the world I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
got upon my back,” said Nat, holding up both
hands and turning slowly around so that his
companion could see him. “I am ready to go if
you are.”</p>

<p>“You must have a clean shirt if nothing
more. What will you do when the one you have
on now is all soiled?”</p>

<p>“I will take it off and wash it.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> will?” exclaimed Peleg, in unbounded
astonishment. “Don’t you have no women to do
that sort of work? My mother always washes
my clothes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are lucky to have a mother. I
have had none since I can remember. I have to
do all such little things myself.”</p>

<p>“This beats me. What did you say to
Jonas?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. I have not seen him since I
saw you.”</p>

<p>“Have you got your papers?” said Peleg,
who was particularly anxious on that score.
“You had better give them to me; because when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Jonas overhauls us he will search all your
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Let him search,” said Nat, turning upon
Peleg and looking at him as closely as he could
in the dark. “I have got my papers, but they are
right in here,” he added, touching his forehead
with his right hand. “He won’t get them out of
there.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” said Peleg, looking down at the
ground they were so rapidly leaving behind.
“That’s a pretty way to do business. You have
got me to help you in looking for that money, and
you had ought to let me into the whole of it.”</p>

<p>“In other words, I must tell you my secret,
must I?” demanded Nat, stopping in his headlong
gait. “I did not agree to do that. You may
go back on me the first thing.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t; I pledge you my word that I
will stay by you. Now if you don’t tell me all of
it I won’t go.”</p>

<p>These were very pleasant words to Nat
Wood. He had been wondering all the time how
he was to be rid of Peleg, and now he was going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
to accomplish his object without half trying. Peleg
stopped when he uttered this threat, but Nat
kept on as fast as ever.</p>

<p>“I tell you I won’t go if you don’t tell me
just what you are going to do and all about it,”
said Peleg, taking his bundle off his shoulders.</p>

<p>“All right. Then stay where you are. I can
get along without you.”</p>

<p>“You forget Jonas and Caleb,” said Peleg,
raising his voice as to reach the ears of Nat who
was rapidly widening the distance between them.
“Who is going to watch them while you are doing
the digging? The little fule,” muttered Peleg,
raising his bundle to his shoulder again and
hurrying after Nat. “What has come over him
to make him so mighty independent all at once?
A little while ago he was just begging me to go
with him; but now he wants to shake me off altogether.
Hold up, Nat.”</p>

<p>But Nat was past holding up for Peleg or
anybody else. He kept on his way without changing
his pace, and when at last Peleg overtook him
he had passed a half a mile down the road.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>“What’s the use of you being in such a
hurry, Nat?” panted Peleg. “I can’t keep up
with you if you go so fast.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hurry in order to get to my
camping grounds before daylight,” replied Nat.
“If you want to go with me, come on; if you
don’t, stay back.”</p>

<p>“But, Nat, it ain’t right for you to do all the
work by yourself,” said Peleg.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to do it all. You must do
some of it, if you go with me. I won’t pay you
a dollar a day for doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I expect to do some of it; but
how can I know what to work at unless you tell
me something.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you what I want as soon as we
come to our camping ground, and that ought to
satisfy you,” said Nat, who plainly saw that he
was not going to get rid of Peleg so easily. “I
may want you to watch for Jonas while I work.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you do that, it will be right into my
hand,” said Peleg, to himself. “Only I would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
rather watch for pap. If I see him, I won’t let
you know a thing about it.”</p>

<p>Seeing that Nat was neither to be frightened
nor coaxed into revealing his secret, Peleg finally
gave up the attempt in disgust, and hurried along
by Nat’s side toward Manchester. Nat had but
little to say to him for he was thinking over what
was to be done when they once reached their
camping grounds. He must be rid of Peleg in
some way, and the more he thought about it the
more he saw that his success depended entirely
upon his finding the money alone and unaided.</p>

<p>“If ever a boy deserves kicking I am the
one,” Nat kept saying to himself. “Why didn’t
I leave Peleg alone husking his corn? He would
have been safe there, but now he has got onto my
back and I can’t shake him off. Can I get him to
go back to the store after some provisions, while
I look for the money? That’s a plan worth thinking
of.”</p>

<p>The way to Manchester seemed wonderfully
long, it is always long if one is anxious to reach
a place, and it was after daylight when they came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
within sight of it. Fortunately the stores were
open and the boys had no difficulty in buying
what they wanted. The first thing was the ammunition
for Peleg’s shotgun; and when that had
been purchased and stowed away in the boy’s valise,
the provisions came next, and they found
that they had more than they could carry.</p>

<p>“There are other things to come,” said Nat,
pulling out his ten dollars at which Peleg glanced
with envious eyes. “I must get a spade and
pick-ax before I go any further.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you want to do with them?”
asked Peleg, in surprise.</p>

<p>“How am I going to do any digging without
them?” asked Nat in reply. “There is no telling
how deep the money is in the ground.”</p>

<p>Peleg was obliged to be content with this explanation
although he was not satisfied with it.
He could not bear to see any of Nat’s money go
for such useless things as a spade and pick-ax,
because he calculated at some future time to handle
all that money himself. And when they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
purchased there was another thing that filled
him with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I wish you would set these implements
away somewhere, together with the provisions
that we shall not be able to take with us, until
Peleg comes after them,” said Nat to the storekeeper.
“He will be after them bright and early
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the storekeeper. “I will
set the whole thing right here in this corner, and
if my partner is in here you will know them when
you see them. Any thing else that I can show
you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else, thank you,” replied Nat “I
have every thing I need.”</p>

<p>“What are you boys going to do up there in
the woods?” asked the storekeeper. “You are
not going after rabbits with nothing but a single
barrel shotgun. You won’t get enough to pay
you for your ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; we are going up there to see about
some timber that belongs to us.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>“Well, don’t let the ghosts catch you,” said
the man, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Ghosts!” replied Peleg; and he let the butt
of his single barrel heavily down upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Yes; there is lots of them up there.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;whereabouts?” inquired Peleg;
and it was all he could do to pronounce the
words so that the storekeeper could understand
him.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that they have any particular
place, but the heft of them appears up
about old man Nickerson’s farm,” said the
man; and he drew a little on his imagination because
he saw that Peleg was frightened. “If
anybody goes on that place he wants to look
out. You see,” here the storekeeper leaned his
elbows on the counter and sank his voice almost
to a whisper. “They used to tell here before the
war that the old man was worth a power of
money, and the rebels came here to gobble it up.”</p>

<p>“Did they get any?” asked Peleg.</p>

<p>“Naw they didn’t. I was in that party and
I know just what they got. It was all in gold, too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
but the old fellow had it hidden so that we could
not find it. We took him off and put him in the
army, but he was too old to be of any use there,
and so we turned him loose. There’s been a
power of men up there looking for it, but they
stay just one night.”</p>

<p>“They see the ghosts, do they?” said Nat</p>

<p>“That’s what they do,” said the storekeeper,
looking all around the room as if he expected to
see something advancing upon him. “And I tell
you they don’t wait until daylight comes. I have
seen as many as two or three on my porch waiting
for me to open the store, and the tales they
told were just awful. They say&mdash;Whew! I’ll
bet you don’t get me up there for no five thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?” asked Nat. “Is old
man Nickerson among the ghosts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is there, and he is the worst one in
the lot; but the worst of it is, he has been somewhere
and got ten or a dozen other ghosts to help
him along, and the screeching they keep up is
enough to drive one crazy. But I reckon you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
boys ain’t going up as far as old man Nickerson’s.”</p>

<p>“That is the place where we are going,” said
Nat. “We shall not stop until we get there.”</p>

<p>“Among all them ghosts?” exclaimed the
storekeeper, and he staggered back from the
counter as if Nat had aimed a blow at him.
“Well, good-by. I shall never see you again,”
added the man, as he straightened up and thrust
his hand out toward Nat. “You need not think
to be free of them for they come to see everybody
that goes there.”</p>

<p>“But the others came back in safety and so
can I,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Yes; but the last time they appeared to a
person they told him that the next one who came
there he would leave his bones for the vultures
to pick over,” said the man, and he tried to shiver
when he uttered the words. “I would not go up
there, if I was you.”</p>

<p>“I want to see what a ghost looks like. Come
on, Peleg. We have wasted too much time already.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
You will have those things ready for Peleg
tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, provided he is able to come after them.
And say, Peleg. I want you to take particular
notice of the way the ghosts look and what they
say and what they do, and all that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You had better get somebody else to go up
there, if that is what you want to find out,” said
Peleg. “If I see one of them, or hear him coming
through the bushes, I will start a running till
you can’t see me for the dust. If Nat isn’t afraid
of the ghosts, I am.”</p>

<p>Nat had by this time taken as many of the
provisions as he could carry and had left the
store, and Peleg, after some hesitation, prepared
to follow him. Nat did not believe in ghosts; and
even if ghosts were there and Mr. Nickerson was
among them, he would not let the rest of the spirits
trouble him, for he had given him the money
before his death, and had told him just where it
was concealed. But his nerves now were not
as firm as they were before he went into that
store. He did not know what he had to contend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
with up there in the woods, and the woods were
so far away from everybody that it was useless
for him to call for help in case he needed it.</p>

<p>“But I am going after that money,” said he,
firmly, as he walked along as if there were no
such things as ghosts in the world. “It is up
there, there was not any ghosts around when it
was hidden and I don’t believe there are any
ghosts now. At least I must see them before I
will give it up.”</p>

<p>At this moment Peleg overtook him. One
glance at his face was enough to show him what
he thought about it.

<span class="medium"><i>Peleg Sees Enough.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Say,</span> Nat,” said Peleg, catching his companion
by the arm and speaking almost in a
whisper as if he were afraid that the
ghosts might overhear him, “don’t let’s go any
further. Let us go back.”</p>

<p>“What will we do with all these provisions?”
exclaimed Nat.</p>

<p>“Let’s take them home and eat them there.
I am afraid to go to those woods. Don’t you believe
in ghosts?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say,” said Nat, pulling
his arm out of Peleg’s grasp. “That storekeeper
talked as though he meant all he said, did
he not? He would not try to scare us.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Peleg, emphatically. “Let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
us go back. I don’t believe there is any money
hidden around here anyway.”</p>

<p>It was no part of Nat’s plan to make Peleg
think differently. If he thought they were on a
wild goose chase, so much the better for Nat. He
would go on and prosecute the search, and if he
succeeded, no one would be the wiser for it.</p>

<p>“If pap were here,” continued Peleg, and
then he suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“Does your father believe in ghosts, too?”
asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Of course he does. He has seen them.”</p>

<p>“Then of course he believes in them. I must
see one before I will put any faith in it.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do if you leave your
bones up here for the vultures to pick?” urged
Peleg, with a shudder. “I reckon you will believe
in them then.”</p>

<p>“That will be my misfortune and not my
fault. So, Mr. Graves believes in ghosts, does
he?” said Nat, to himself. “I wish to goodness
that I knew whether or not Jonas and Caleb believed
in them, too. Somehow I feel more afraid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of those two men than I do of anything else.”
Then aloud he said: “If I believed as your
father does I would not come up here for anything;
but I have not seen the ghosts yet, and until
I do, I am going to stick to my plan. You can
carry the provisions up to Mr. Nickerson’s house,
can’t you, and then you can put them down and
go back if you want to.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean that you are really going
on?” exclaimed Peleg, who was really amazed
at the boy’s courage.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am going on; and no one will
care whether I succeed or not. Come on, Peleg.
You must walk faster than that.”</p>

<p>There was no use of trying to get rid of Peleg;
Nat saw that plainly enough. He increased
his pace and Peleg, as if afraid of being left behind,
increased his own and readily kept up with
him. He did not have any more to say about the
ghosts until after they had covered the half of a
dozen miles that lay between them and Mr.
Nickerson’s farm; and then they turned off the
road, climbed a fence and found themselves in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
thicket of bushes which enveloped them on all
sides so that they could not see two feet in advance
of them. Then Peleg’s courage gave away
altogether.</p>

<p>“I believe I won’t go any further,” said he;
and he made a move as if he were going to put
down the provisions he was carrying. “It is
awful dark in there, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty dark,” whispered Nat, bending
down and trying to see through the bushes. “But
this is nothing to what it will be when night
comes. If we are going to hear anything we will
hear it then. Will you be afraid to come down
here to get the spade and pick-ax to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“You just bet I will,” answered Peleg, and
Nat noticed that his face was as white as it could
get. “If you don’t get that spade and pick-ax
until I bring them up to you, you will wait a long
while before you do any digging.”</p>

<p>“Well, pick up the provisions and come
along,” said Nat, who was getting really impatient.
“Stay right close behind me, and if I
see any ghosts I will shoo them off.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>Once more Nat started on and Peleg, not
daring to remain behind, gathered up his burden
and kept along close on his heels. It was a long
way through the bushes to the back of Mr. Nickerson’s
farm, and with almost every step Peleg
heard something that alarmed him; a bird chirped
in the thicket close beside him or a ground
squirrel vociferously scolded them as they drew
near and hurried off to his retreat, and several
times he was on the point of throwing down the
provisions and taking to his heels. But there
was the money that they were after. That had a
stronger attraction to him than his fear of the
ghosts, and when Nat threw aside the last branch
and stepped out into the open field, Peleg was
right behind, although he was all out of breath
and sweating so, as he affirmed, that he could hear
it rattling on the leaves.</p>

<p>“When we go back let us go the other way,”
panted Peleg, looking around for a place to sit
down. “I am just tired out. Now what are you
going to do? Here is the spot, and if you have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
not got them papers with you, how do you know
where to dig?”</p>

<p>“The papers are all in my head where no
one will get them,” said Nat, laying down his
armful of provisions and looking around to see
if there was a path that led down the hill. “You
stay here and rest, and I will go on and see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not much I won’t stay here,” exclaimed
Peleg, rising to his feet as Nat started off. “I
am going to stay close by you. I wish I had
known about the ghosts. I wouldn’t have come
one peg.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Nat to himself. “If I can
get up some way to scare you to-night, I shall be
happy.”</p>

<p>To have seen Nat go to work one would have
supposed that he knew where the money was hidden
and all about it. He went as straight as he
could go to the corner of the ruins of Mr. Nickerson’s
house, and there he stopped and his lips
moved as if he were holding a consultation with
himself.</p>

<p>“Six to one and a half dozen to the other,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
he muttered, as if he were not aware that Peleg
was anywhere within reach of him. “That paper
is burned up here in the ruins, but I have got
it in my head.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to get through yourself,
Nat?” said Peleg. “Talk English so that
I can understand you.”</p>

<p>Nat did not act as though he had heard him
at all.</p>

<p>“The next is a beech tree on the right hand
side,” continued Nat. “Now let me see if that
can be found.”</p>

<p>“What about the beech tree? There is one
down there at the foot of the hill.”</p>

<p>Nat had already started off toward the beech
tree, and a little way from it found a pile of
briers; but did not look at them more than once.
He went around on the left hand side of the beech
tree, and throwing back his head gazed earnestly
into the branches.</p>

<p>“Now whichever way that limb points, it
points to the hiding-place of the papers,” said
“But there are not any limbs that point
Nat. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
any way. They all seem to point upward to the
sky. If this is the tree I’ll soon make the limb
move. Here, watch that branch and see if it
don’t stir. Six of one and half a dozen of the
other.”</p>

<p>“What do you keep saying those words for
all the time?” inquired Peleg. “Why don’t you
talk so that I can understand it?”</p>

<p>“That is a secret that Mr. Nickerson used
while he was engaged in burying the papers,”
said Nat, a bright idea striking him. “Come
here and I will tell you all about it,” he added,
catching Peleg by the arm and drawing his face
close to his own. “You see these trees and
everything about here is in sympathy with Mr.
Nickerson, because he is dead, you know. I
might come up here or you might come up here
and look for those papers, and if we did not have
the secret that Mr. Nickerson used while concealing
them, why, we wouldn’t know any more
about it than we do now. I declare that branch
moves; don’t you see it?”</p>

<p>Peleg looked earnestly into the tree but could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
see nothing. Nat even got hold of him and pulled
him around and twisted his head on one side so
that he could see the upper part of the tree, but
the moving of the limb was something that Peleg
could not discern.</p>

<p>“It only moved a little bit so that I could
see it,” said Nat, in explanation. “You have
got to be quick or you can’t see it. Now we will
go off this way and see if we can find something
else.”</p>

<p>There was some little thing about this that
was certainly uncanny&mdash;something that did not
look natural to Peleg. The idea of a boy having
some mysterious words at his command which
made inanimate nature obey him was a new
thing to him, and he did not know what to make
of it; but Nat seemed to think it was all right
and went ahead as if he had been expecting it.
He stepped across the brook and moved up the
hill, but before he had taken many steps he came
back and put his face close to Peleg’s again.</p>

<p>“I must tell you one thing so that you will
not be frightened,” said he, in a whisper.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
“When I get on the track of those papers you’ll
hear something.”</p>

<p>“What is it like?” said Peleg, in the same
cautious whisper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It may be like the report
of a cannon; or it may be like something else you
never heard of. You must keep your mind on
those papers while we are looking for them.”</p>

<p>Nat went on ahead and in a few moments
more he stepped upon the very stone which was
buried half way in the earth and covered the hiding
place of his money. His heart bounded at
the thought. If Peleg was away and he had the
pick-ax and spade at his command he would be
a rich boy in less than half an hour.</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” said he, dolefully.</p>

<p>“Don’t see what?” said Peleg. “If you
repeat your words once more perhaps it will come
to you.”</p>

<p>“Six of one and a half dozen of the other,”
exclaimed Nat; and instantly there came a response
that he had not been expecting. A huge
dead poplar, which stood on the bank a hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
feet away, suddenly aroused itself into life and
action, took part in Nat’s invocation and sent a
thrill of terror through him and Peleg. A branch
of the tree about fifty feet from the ground, as
large as any of the ordinary trees that were standing
around them, ceased its hold upon the parent
trunk and came with a stunning crash to the
ground. Peleg was so startled that he fairly
jumped, while Nat stood perfectly thunderstruck.</p>

<p>This was nothing more than the boys had
been accustomed to all their lives. Such sounds
were not new in the country in which they had
been brought up, and when any settler heard a
sound like that coming from the woods he said:
“Now we are going to have falling weather.”
An old “deadening” is the best place to watch
for omens of this kind. The farmer, not having
the time or force to clear his land, cuts away all
the underbrush and uses his axe to “circle” the
trees so that he can put in his crop. The trees
stand there until they dry and rot, all the vitality
being taken away from them, and finally drop
all their limbs until the trunk stands bare. Nat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
after he had taken time to think twice, knew in a
moment what had caused the poplar to shed its
limbs, and was aware that it was one of the incidents
of his everyday life; but Peleg, who had
been warned that something was going to happen
if they found the trail of the papers, was frightened
out of his wits. After it struck the ground
he remained motionless.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” whispered Nat.
“Didn’t I tell you that you would hear something
drop?”</p>

<p>“Whew!” stammered Peleg. “I have seen
enough of this place. I am going home as quick
as I can go.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Peleg,” exclaimed Nat, who was
overjoyed to hear him talk this way. “We will
hear something else pretty soon, and that will let
us know that we are close to the papers.”</p>

<p>“You can stay and look for them until you
are blind,” said Peleg, who was taking long
strides toward the other side of the brook. “You
will never see them papers. I believe you are
cahoots with the ‘Old Fellow’ himself.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>As Peleg said this he pointed with his finger
toward the ground. He did not care to mention
who the “old fellow” was. When he was across
the brook he broke into a run and dashed up the
hill. He did not even stop to take with him his
gun, ammunition or the provisions he had
brought up from Manchester. He kept clear of
the bushes&mdash;you could not have hired Peleg to go
through them alone&mdash;and when he struck the
open field he increased his pace and was out of
sight in a moment. Nat waited until he was well
under way and then followed him to the top of
the bank. He was just in time to see Peleg’s coat
tails disappear over the bars; and then he dug
out at his best gait for home.</p>

<p>“There!” said Nat taking off his hat and
feeling for the extra money he had stowed away.
“I am well rid of him, thank goodness.
Now I will go to work and make a camp, get
something to eat, and to-morrow morning I will
go down and get the spade and pick-ax; that is, if
the ghosts leave anything of me. But I don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
believe there are any ghosts. The storekeeper
said that just to frighten him.”</p>

<p>But before Nat began his lean-to he wanted
to see the stone that covered his fortune. It
seemed strange to him that all he had to do was
to pry the stone out of its place, dig for a few
minutes and then he would be worth more money
than he ever saw.</p>

<p>“There is one thing that I forgot,” said he,
after he had tested the weight of the stone by
trying his strength upon it. “But I will get that
to-morrow. I must cut a lever with which to
handle this weight.”</p>

<p>For the first time in a long while Nat was
happy. He would be so that night&mdash;there would
not anybody come near him after dark&mdash;but
the next morning he would come back to himself
again&mdash;sly and cunning, and afraid to make
a move in any direction without carefully reconnoitering
the ground. Jonas and Caleb had got
him in the way of living so.</p>

<p>“But I will soon be free from them,” said
Nat, as he left the stone walked across the brook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
and seated himself proceeded to find some of the
cheese and crackers which Peleg had brought up.
“I am free from them now; but if they come
after me and catch me, why then I have got my
whole business to do over again. I hope Peleg
will go safely home and spread the story of the
ghosts that are living here, for I don’t think
Jonas will care to face them.”</p>

<p>Nat thoroughly enjoyed his meal, for the
walk of twenty miles along that rough road was
enough to give him an appetite, and all the while
he was looking about him and selecting the limbs
with which he intended to build his lean-to. He
did not expect to be there a great while, not
longer than to-morrow at any rate, but he did not
believe in sleeping out while there was timber
enough at hand to build him a shelter. The lean-to
was soon put up, and in a very short space of
time all the luggage he had was conveyed
under it. A fire would come handy as soon as it
grew dark, and all the rest of the time he spent
in collecting fuel for it; so that when the sun
went down and it began to grow gloomy in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
woods, he was as well sheltered as a boy in his
circumstances could expect.</p>

<p>“I am glad that Peleg is not here,” said
Nat, as he looked all around to make sure that he
had not forgotten something, and began another
assault on the crackers and cheese. “I know
that nothing will come here to bother me, but
Peleg would all the while be listening for one of
those ghosts to come down on him. There’s an
owl now. His hooting sounds awful lonely in
the woods.”</p>

<p>While Nat was stretched out on his bed of
boughs listening to the mournful notes of the
owl, his thoughts were exceedingly busy with
sad remembrances of the old man who had
labored so hard to save his money from the
rebels, little dreaming that the amount would one
day fall into the hands of one who needed it as
badly as Nat did.</p>

<p>“I really wish I had some one to enjoy it
with me, but I have not got any body,” Nat kept
saying to himself. “The first thing I will do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
will be to get an education; then I can tell what
I am going to do.”</p>

<p>So saying Nat arose and replenished the fire,
then lay down and fell into a quiet sleep. He
did not see a ghost nor did he dream of one the
whole night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Peleg’s Ghost Story.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Bless</span> my lucky stars, Peleg Graves, you
clear of Nat Wood at last. Ever since
I first met him there at home, when he
didn’t have a single thing to take with him except
the clothes he had on his back, I have been afraid
of that fellow. He didn’t have but one shirt to
bless himself with, and when it got soiled, he
would take it off and wash it. The idea of him
washing his clothes! I guess he thought that the
Old Fellow would wash them.” Here Peleg cast
frightened glances toward the bushes on each side
of the road as if he was fearful that “the other
fellow” would suddenly come out at him. He
fancied he could almost see him with his flashing
eyes, horns on his head and cloven feet all ready
to take the rush, but as he went on he began to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
gather courage. “And then his having a secret,
too, and he wouldn’t tell me what it meant. ‘Here
I am and there I am,’” whispered Peleg, who
was so badly frightened that he could not remember
the words Nat had used. “Now what did
those words mean? I tell you there is somebody
helping Nat; you hear me?”</p>

<p>While Peleg was going over his soliloquy in
this way he was making good time down the road,
and finally he became weary with his headlong
pace and slackened his gait to a walk; a fast walk
it was, too, so that in a very short while all Nat
and his strange words were left behind.</p>

<p>It was twenty miles to the place where Peleg
lived, and although faint with hunger and so
weary that he could scarcely drag one foot after
the other, he never stopped to ask one of the good-hearted
settlers for a bite to eat, and never
thought of sitting down to rest his tired limbs.
He kept on, anxious to get his roof over his head
and impatient to hear what his father would have
to say about Nat and his doings, until just as the
sun was rising he came within sight of the cabin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
door and saw Mr. Graves standing there and taking
a look at the weather. The man was so surprised
to see him that he was obliged to take two
looks before he could make up his mind that it
was Peleg and nobody else.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Peleg?” he exclaimed, as the
boy threw down one of the bars and crawled
through it “Where’s the money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pap!” was all that Peleg could say in
reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Graves began to look uneasy. Like all
ignorant men he was very superstitious, and he
straightway believed that Peleg had seen something
that he could not understand.</p>

<p>“Say, Peleg,” he added in a lower tone,
stepping off the porch and taking the boy by the
arm. “What did you see up there in the woods?
You have not been to Manchester and back, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have, too; and if you want to go
down there and search for that money, you can
go; but I am going to stay here. I wish you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
would give me a bite to eat and a drink of water.
I am just about dead.”</p>

<p>Peleg had by this time reached the porch,
and he threw himself down upon it as if he had
lost all strength, and rested his head upon his
hands. Mr. Graves began to believe that Peleg
had seen something that was rather more than his
nerves could stand, and went around the house
after a drink of water, while his mother, who had
been aroused by this time, came to the door. She
saw Peleg sitting there with his head buried in
his hands, and of course her mother’s heart went
out to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Peleg, what is the matter?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, you just ought to hear the
words that Nat uses to find out whether or not
he is on the trail of those papers,” said Peleg,
lifting a very haggard face and looking at her.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Graves came around the
corner of the house with a gourd full of drinking
water. Peleg seized it as though he had not had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
any for a month, and never let the gourd go until
he had drunk the whole of it.</p>

<p>“That makes me feel some better,” said he.</p>

<p>“You passed several streams on the way,”
said Mr. Graves. “Why didn’t you stop and get
a drink?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pap, I dassent. I can hear those words
ringing in my ears now, and I wanted to get so
far away that I couldn’t hear them. ‘Here I am
and there I am!’ Oh, my soul!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what are you trying to get through
yourself?” inquired Mr. Graves; and if the truth
must be told he drew a little closer to Peleg.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am telling you the truth when
I say that that there Nat has some dealings with
that Fellow down there,” said Peleg, pointing
toward the ground. “He goes around looking
for those papers&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! Get out!” exclaimed Graves.</p>

<p>“It is a fact; and if you don’t believe it, you
can just go down there and watch him as I did.
He says that everything, the trees and the rocks
and the leaves and the bushes, are in cahoots with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
him because he took such good care of old man
Nickerson when he was alive, buying him tobacco
and such, and that he told him what words
to use while looking for those papers. Why, the
branches of the trees moved and pointed out the
way to him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves was completely amazed by this
revelation, and seated himself on the porch beside
Peleg; while S’manthy gasped for breath
and found it impossible for her to say anything.
She lifted her hands in awe toward the rafters
of the porch for a moment, closed her eyes, and
then her hands fell helplessly by her side. She
shook her head but could not utter a sound.</p>

<p>“It is a fact, I tell you; that isn’t all I have
seen, either,” said Peleg. “When we came to
Manchester and Nat wanted to buy some grub
and things&mdash;pap, he has ten dollars; and he
wouldn’t offer me a cent of it.”</p>

<p>“Where did he get ten dollars?” asked Mr.
Graves, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I expect it must have been
some he had left that the old man gave him. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
bought some grub and a pick-ax and a spade, and
left them there so that I could go and get them
this morning; and that set the storekeeper to going.
He warned me not to let the ghosts catch
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, my soul!” exclaimed S’manthy, raising
her hands toward the rafters again. “Have
they got ghosts up there?”</p>

<p>“You just bet they have,” answered Peleg,
trembling all over. “But Nat didn’t seem afraid
of them at all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves leaned back against the post
near which he was sitting, stretched his legs out
straight before him and looked fixedly at the
ground. He had never heard of ghosts being in
the woods, and this made him wonder if he would
dare go after the cows when they failed to come
up.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you had better go back there
any more, Peleg,” said he, when he had taken
time to think the matter over.</p>

<p>“You may just bet I won’t go back. I have
not got use for a boy who will talk to them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
language I cannot understand. And worse than
that, he led the way to old man Nickerson’s farm
by the back way, through bushes that grew thicker’n
the hair on a dog’s back, and he wanted me
to come back the same way. Mighty clear of
me!”</p>

<p>“I reckon we had best go and let Jonas know
about this,” said Mr. Graves, after thinking once
more upon the matter.</p>

<p>“Well, you can go and I will stay here and
get something to eat,” said Peleg. “He will
find Nat within a few rods of the old man’s house.
Dog-gone such luck! Why couldn’t the old man
have left his money out in plain sight so that a
fellow could get it?”</p>

<p>“Did you see any of the ghosts?” said his
mother, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, and I kept a close watch for
them, too. You see Nat says they don’t come
around until at night. I wonder if there is anything
left of that boy up there?”</p>

<p>“I hope to goodness that they have cleaned
him out entirely,” said Mr. Graves, angrily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
“If we can’t have any of that money I don’t
want him to have it, either. Now you go in and
take a bite, and I will make up my mind what
we are going to do.”</p>

<p>“Are you waiting for me to go up to Jonas’s
house with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon you had better. You have
been up there and saw how the matter stands, and
you can tell him better than I can.”</p>

<p>“I am mighty glad he won’t ask me to go
back to old man Nickerson’s woods with him,”
whispered Peleg, as he followed his mother into
the house. “I wouldn’t stir a peg to please anybody.”</p>

<p>“What do ghosts look like, Peleg?” asked
S’manthy, as she brought out a plate of cold
bread and meat and set them on the table
before the boy. “I have often heard of them
but I never saw them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. I looked everywhere for
them, but they would not show up. I’ll bet
Nat can tell by this time how they look&mdash;that is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
if he did not get scared at them like myself and
run away.”</p>

<p>By the time that Peleg had satisfied his appetite
Mr. Graves had thought over the situation
and determined upon his course. He would not
go near Mr. Nickerson’s farm&mdash;he was as close
to it as he wanted to be; but he would go up and
tell Jonas what Peleg had seen. Jonas was a
good fellow, and perhaps he would do as much
for him under the same circumstances. If Jonas
and Caleb thought enough of the money that was
hidden there to go up and face the ghosts, that
was their lookout and not his.</p>

<p>“You had your gun, Peleg,” said Mr.
Graves, when the boy came out the door and put
on his hat “Why didn’t you depend upon
that!”</p>

<p>“Course I had my gun; but it was not loaded.
I declare, I never once thought of that old
single barrel.”</p>

<p>“If one of them had seen that gun in your
hands&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shaw! I ain’t thinking of that. I ran
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
away so quick that I left it behind. Maybe Nat
used it last night.”</p>

<p>“But you say he ain’t afraid of them,” suggested
his father. “What should he want to
use your gun for?”</p>

<p>“Of course he ain’t afraid of them in the
day-time; but when it comes down dark night in
the woods, and you hear the bushes rattling and
something go g-g-r-r&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Peleg, stop!” ejaculated his mother,
who was all in a tremble.</p>

<p>“Stop your noise, Peleg,” said Mr. Graves,
who could not bear to hear him imitate the ghosts
in this way. “Maybe they don’t go that way at
all.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you want to find out, you had best
go up there and stay all night,” said Peleg, shaking
his head in a wise manner. “And I will
tell you another thing that happened while I was
up there. Nat told me that I must not be frightened,
for when he got onto the trail of those
papers again&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>“Did he lose the trail of them?” asked Mr.
Graves.</p>

<p>“I reckon so; for he looked up into a tree
and said: ‘Here I am and there I am,’ and the
tree showed him which way to go.”</p>

<p>“Aw! Get out,” exclaimed Mr. Graves.
“Could a tree speak to him or point with its
branches to tell him when he was going wrong?”</p>

<p>“That tree did as sure as you live,” said
Peleg confidently.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir, I did. That tree was standing like
any other tree, with its branches pointing upward,
and when he said those words of his, one
of the limbs pointed out so,” said Peleg, indicating
the movement with his finger.</p>

<p>Mr. Graves looked rather hard at Peleg,
as if he did not know whether to believe the
statement or not, and the boy met his gaze without
flinching. When Peleg told a lie he generally
looked down at the ground.</p>

<p>“Well, go on. What did you see next?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, when we got a little further he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
said I would hear something pretty soon, and it
would make me wish that I had never been born.
I tell you I did hear it, and&mdash;Oh, my soul! How
can I ever tell it!”</p>

<p>“What did it sound like, Peleg?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p>“A dead tree was standing a short distance
away and when Nat went on with his words:
‘Here I am and there I am,’ one of the branches
on that tree let go all holds and came down to the
ground with a crash and broke all to pieces. I
certainly thought I was going with it, too.”</p>

<p>For the first time that day Mr. Graves uttered
an exclamation of disgust, turned on his heel
and went into the house for his rifle.</p>

<p>“You can hear those sounds right here on
the place,” remarked his mother. “That’s
nothing new.”</p>

<p>“The little fule!” exclaimed Mr. Graves,
who just then came out again with his rifle.
“You got so frightened with the ghosts that you
don’t know the signs of falling weather when you
hear them. It is going to rain very shortly.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>“Well, I just want you to go up there if you
dare,” said Peleg, somewhat taken aback by this
explanation of the phenomenon which had frightened
him. “Here you are, making all sorts of
fun at my ghost stories, and you have gone and
got your rifle to protect you. Leave that at home
if you are not afraid to go up to Jonas’s house
without it.”</p>

<p>“No, I reckon I will just take it along.
What you have said about the ghosts may be
true; but I don’t believe in such things as the
trees and bushes telling him where to go. Come
on now, and we’ll go up and see Jonas.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to leave me here all
alone?” inquired Mrs. Graves, who went into the
house for a shawl to throw over her head. “I’m
going, too.”</p>

<p>“Now, S’manthy,” began her husband.</p>

<p>“I know all about it; but I ain’t a going to
stay here all by myself after such talk as we
have had,” said the woman, determinedly. “I
have some business with Jonas’s wife as much as
you have with him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>Mr. Graves said no more. He probably
knew how an argument would come out with his
wife. He cast apprehensive glances at the bushes
as he walked along, and seemed to be much occupied
with his own thoughts. The money was
there, there could be no mistake about that, and
he had intended to go up there that very day so as
to be on hand in case Peleg needed assistance;
but the boy’s returning home with such a story
had put new ideas into his head. Taking into
consideration the way he felt now he would not
have gone a step toward Mr. Nickerson’s woods
if he knew the foot of every tree in them had a
gold mine buried beneath it which he could
have for the digging. He fully credited the tales
about the ghosts; the rest of it he did not put
any faith in.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of my dreams,” he muttered,
as he walked along. “I say as Peleg did,
dog-gone such luck! If the old man had left his
money out where we could find it, well and good;
but, as it stands, I have got to be a poor man all
my life.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>In due time they arrived at Jonas’s house
where they found his wife engaged in getting
breakfast while her husband, with Caleb to help
him, was engaged, down to the barn. Mrs.
Graves stopped in the house, which she speedily
turned upside down with her stories, while Mr.
Graves kept on and found Jonas sitting on an
inverted bucket, meditatively chewing a piece of
straw, and Caleb walking around with his hands
in his pockets. They had been discussing Nat’s
absence, but they could not come to any determination
about it. Nat was gone, it was money
took him away and how were they going to work
to cheat him out of it?</p>

<p>“Howdy,” said Jonas, who, upon looking
up, discovered Mr. Graves approaching. “Have
you started out bright and early this morning to
go hunting?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;no,” replied Mr. Graves, taking his
rifle from his shoulder. “I did not know but I
might see a squirrel or two bobbing around.
Seen anything of Nat lately?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>“No, I have not. Do you know what has
become of him?”</p>

<p>“You’re right I do. He is up to old man
Nickerson’s woods.”</p>

<p>“There now. We always allowed that he
had gone up there. Has he got onto the trail of
any money?”</p>

<p>“He has, but that’s all the good it will do
him. Peleg has been up there with him.”</p>

<p>Jonas simply nodded his head as if to say
that he knew as much long ago. He learned it
when he went to Mr. Graves’ house to inquire
about Nat.</p>

<p>“But it won’t do him any good, getting on
the trail of that money won’t,” continued Mr.
Graves. “There are ghosts up in those woods.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts!” exclaimed Jonas and Caleb in a
breath. They looked hard at Mr. Graves and
then they looked at Peleg. The boy simply
nodded to show that his father was right.</p>

<p>“Did you see any of them?” asked Caleb,
who was in a fair way of being frightened.</p>

<p>“Naw; I didn’t see any of them nor hear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
them, I didn’t stay long enough for that I
took my foot in my hand and came home.”</p>

<p>“Peleg has &amp; long story to tell, and I thought
you would rather hear it from him than anybody
else, so I brought him along.”</p>

<p>As this was the introduction to Peleg’s story
those who were standing up found places to sit
down, and waited impatiently for him to begin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Nat’s Fortune</i>.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Well,</span> sir, I have slept all night in these
woods alone and there has no ghost
been near to warn me that I had better
quit my search and go home,” said Nat, sitting
up on his bed of boughs and rubbing his
eyes. “I reckon the ghosts all exist in that storekeeper’s
imagination. Now I must take a good
look at that rock again, eat some crackers and
cheese and go down after that spade and pick-ax.
By this time tomorrow I shall be a rich man.”</p>

<p>Nat had often wondered how much there was
of that money that was hidden away, and he
was always obliged to confess that he did not
know. The neighbors all insisted that old man
Nickerson was “powerful rich,” and acting upon
this supposition he thought that about $5,000
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
would amply repay him for all his trouble. That
would get him a nice education, and that was all
that Nat asked for. He could then take care of
himself.</p>

<p>Nat sprang off his bed, performed the hasty
operation of washing his hands and face in the
brook, and not having any towel to wipe upon,
went up the bank toward the stone, shaking the
water off his hands as he went. The rock was
all there; he was certain on that point. If he
had that spade and pick-ax in his hands he would
soon know how much he was worth. The only
trouble with him now was, to dig it up, reach
St. Louis with it in some way or other and put
it in the bank. Once there he would like to see
Jonas and Caleb get their hands upon it.</p>

<p>The next thing was breakfast, and that was
very soon dispatched, and then he tried to make
himself a little more respectable to the persons
who met him on the way by brushing off his
clothes and bringing some pins into play to hide
his rents. Then he stood up and looked at himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>“They will show anyway, I don’t care how
I pin them,” said Nat, at length. “Well, what’s
the odds? Everyone knows how I lived there
under that man’s roof, and I can’t be expected to
look any better. Maybe I will look as well as the
best of them one of these days.”</p>

<p>Nat’s first care was to hide Peleg’s gun and
ammunition for fear that some one might come
along and appropriate them to his own use. The
whole thing was not worth two dollars, but still
that would be something for Peleg to lose. He
would go frantic if he found that the gun had
been stolen. This done he was ready to leave
his camp and he took the near way through the
bushes; and when they had closed up behind him
he could not help thinking how frightened Peleg
was when he came through there. He neither
saw nor heard anything alarming, and in a short
time he climbed the fence and was out in the road.
As luck would have it a team was going by, and
the man pulled up his horses and offered him a
ride.</p>

<p>“Going fur?” said he. “Well jump in.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Nat “It’s about six
miles to Manchester, and I believe it is cheaper
riding than walking.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing down there in old man
Nickerson’s?” asked the man. “Ain’t you the
boy that lives with old man Keeler! I hear
that old man Nickerson is dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes sir. He just died a few days ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, how much did he leave old man Jonas’s
wife! I hear he was powerful rich.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how much he was worth, but
I don’t believe he left anything.”</p>

<p>“Now that is mighty mean of him. He has
some money somewhere, and the man what finds
it is rich as Julius Caesar.”</p>

<p>“I thought he must be worth $5,000 dollars,”
said Nat.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Say $15,000 or $20,000, and you
will just about hit it. You see some fellows living
around here think that the rebels got it, but
the old man was too sharp for them. Then they
got mad and burned his house and left him out in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the cold; and then Jonas took him in. Did he
leave Jonas anything!”</p>

<p>“No, I am quite sure he did not. Are there
any ghosts down here in the woods!”</p>

<p>“Naw. There are some fellows who have
been up here a time or two, and when they
came back they told wonderful stories of what
they had seen back there in the timber. But
there is nothing to it.”</p>

<p>Nat became silent after this and so did the
man He began to be real uneasy now, for there
was a difference in the sum the old man had left
behind him. He drew a long breath every time
he thought of the wide gulf there was between
$5,000 and $15,000 or $20,000, so much so that
the driver looked at him in surprise; but he had
nothing to say for which Nat was very thankful.
In due time they arrived at Manchester, and Nat,
after thanking the man once more for his kindness,
sprang from the wagon and went into the
store.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I declare, if one of them boys
hasn’t come back,” said the storekeeper, hurrying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
forward to shake hands with Nat. “Did you
see any of them ghosts and what did they say
to you!”</p>

<p>“I did not see one,” said Nat, with a smile.
“I guess last night was not their night to come
out. Have you got my things handy?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir. They are right up here where I
put them. But what has become of your pardner?”</p>

<p>“You scared him out.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he has run away? Well,
I am sorry for that,” said the storekeeper, on
receiving an affirmative nod from Nat.</p>

<p>“I am not sorry for it,” said Nat to himself.
“It gave me just the chance I was waiting for&mdash;to
dig without his knowing it.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for the man to ask him any
more questions Nat picked up the things he had
left behind, including the pick-ax and spade, and
turned to go out when the storekeeper evidently
wanted some other matters settled.</p>

<p>“You said yesterday that you were going up
to them woods to look for timber,” said he.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
“Now what do you want to do with those
things!” he went on, pointing to the spade and
pick-ax.</p>

<p>“There are some other things we wanted
to fix,” said Nat, without an instant’s hesitation.
“We are going to put in some crops there, and
we want to repair the old man’s fence which has
become torn down during the war.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the man, staring rather hard
at Nat. “You will need an ax, then.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me. I came pretty near forgetting
it.”</p>

<p>Nat laid down his bundles again and the
man turned to get the implement he had spoken
of, and while he was getting it down he kept
his eyes fastened on Nat’s face. But he said
nothing more and saw him take his purchases
and leave the store.</p>

<p>“Now maybe that story will do and maybe it
won’t,” said the man, as he came out from behind
the counter and watched Nat going along
the street. “There is something else that you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
want to dig for. I wonder if it is the old man’s
money?”</p>

<p>“They say that he had sights and gobs of
it when he buried it to keep it out of the hands
of the rebels,” said a man who was seated in the
back part of the store, and who now came up to
listen to what the storekeeper had to say. “But
the rebels didn’t get none of it. He hid it where
they couldn’t find it.”</p>

<p>“They say he is living up to Jonas Keeler’s,”
said the first.</p>

<p>“Old man Nickerson is dead. He has been
dead two or three days. It is a wonder you had
not heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, that boy is going to dig for the
money,” said the storekeeper, doubling up his
huge fist and bringing it down upon the counter.
“Now what be we going to do about it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any other way than for
me and you to go up there and watch him while
he digs for it,” said the customer, in a whisper.
“When he gets it dug up, we’ll just take it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>“And what will the boy do?” asked the
storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can easy fool him. Let us play
ghosts.”</p>

<p>That was something new to the storekeeper.
He drew nearer to his customer and the two
whispered long and earnestly. At length they
seemed to agree upon a plan, for the customer
went out and the storekeeper went back to his
place behind the counter.</p>

<p>“I let that fellow talk too much,” said Nat,
as he walked hurriedly away with his bundles in
his arms. “He knows that I want to dig in the
ground, or else I wouldn’t have called for these
things. I must get back to my camp and go to
work as soon as possible, or else I shall have
some one else on my back.”</p>

<p>Nat was now harassed by another fear and
to save his life he could not shake it off. That
storekeeper at Manchester knew there was no
such thing as ghosts in the woods, he knew that
Peleg had been frightened away by the bare mention
of such objects as might be around in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
event of their search proving successful, and how
did he know but that the storekeeper and some
one like him, might take it into their heads to
come up and look into the matter. He was
now more afraid of those men than he was of
Jonas and Caleb.</p>

<p>“I tell you it all depends upon getting my
work done quick,” said Nat, turning about and
looking at the store. “That storekeeper will
come up there for fifteen or twenty&mdash;By gracious!
I wish I had that money dug up now.”</p>

<p>The longer Nat dwelt upon the matter the
greater haste seemed necessary and the longer
the distance was to the Nickerson woods. He
broke into a dog trot before he was fairly out of
sight of the city, and by the time he climbed the
fence that threaded the bushes he was nearly exhausted.
Everything there was just as he left it;
but so out of breath was Nat that he threw himself
on his bed of boughs and heartily wished he
possessed the strength of a dozen men. At length
he sprang up and went to work. He must do
something or else see his fortune slip through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
his grasp. He cut the lever with which to move
the rock, trimmed it off neatly and catching up
his pick-ax and spade he jumped across the
brook and made his way up the hill. Hastily
clearing away the bushes that had grown up
around the rock he thrust his lever under one side
of it, got under the other end, and to his surprise
the rock moved with scarcely an effort on his
part.</p>

<p>“Hail Columbia happy land!” gasped Nat,
as he eased up for a moment on the lever and
surged upon it to obtain a new hold upon the
rock. “The thing moves, and that proves that
it has been pried out of its bed before. Come
out here and let us see what’s under you.”</p>

<p>The rock was heavier than Nat thought it
was, but by dint of sheer hard work he finally
succeeded in getting it out of its bed and moved
away so that he could use his spade. To have
seen him go about his work one would have
thought he had an all day’s job before him and
that he was to ask for his pay when his work was
done. Although his face was very white and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
hands trembled, he took a spadeful of earth before
he threw it out, and once, when he saw the
perspiration gathering upon him, he stopped,
took off his hat and wiped his forehead ere he set
in again.</p>

<p>“I just know there is something here, but I
will take it easy and by the time I strike the money&mdash;but
perhaps it isn’t money at all,” murmured
Nat, pausing in his exertions to see how
much he had accomplished. “Whatever there
is, it has got to come out.”</p>

<p>Before Nat got down as far as he wanted to
go he came to the conclusion that Mr. Nickerson
must have thought that he had plenty of time
at his disposal, for he dug down at least two feet
before he struck anything. But the earth was
soft, in all these years it had not become packed
at all, and that showed that there had been somebody
there before him. At length his spade
hit something hard&mdash;something which he could
not remove. He dug down by the side of it and
then found that it was a board which completely
filled up the space. To get the dirt off of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
rest of the board was comparatively easy, and
then Nat threw out his spade, stepped to one
side and placed his hands under it. The sight
that met his gaze was enough to deprive him of
the little strength he had left. The space below
him was literally filled up with bags&mdash;small bags,
to be sure, but one of them was so heavy that
when Nat came to lift it from its place and put
it out of the hole so that he could examine it, he
found that handling it was quite as much as he
wanted to do.</p>

<p>“Hail Columbia happy land!” said Nat
again. “I am in luck for once in my life. There
is more than $5,000 in that bag.”</p>

<p>Nat followed the bag out of the hole, carefully
untied the string with which it was closed
and he was astonished at what he saw. The
bag was filled with gold pieces, twenties and tens
and fives down to ones. That one bag alone
must have contained almost the sum he had
named.</p>

<p>“Now everything depends upon my quickness,”
said Nat, seating himself beside the bag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
and looking thoughtfully at the others. “What
shall I do with them now that I have got them?
I must put them somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Nat went about this work as though he could
see into the future and knew what was going to
happen there in his camp in less than ten minutes.
He sprang into the hole again and as fast
as he could raise the bags they came out on the
earth he had shoveled up. Then he came out and
running into his camp seized Peleg’s valise and
emptied the contents upon the ground. It was
better than nothing, although it would not hold
more than two bags. The other one he carried
under his arm and then began looking around for
some place to hide them. It did not matter much
where he put them so long as they could effectually
hide the spot from curious eyes. At last
he stopped before a huge log which had a quantity
of leaves piled against it. To scrape those
leaves away with his hands was an easy matter,
and his bags were hastily put in, and yet
there was enough for three others. They were
quickly stowed away in the new place, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the spade Nat made everything look as natural
as it did before.</p>

<p>The next thing was to fill up the hole and
restore the rock to its bed. It seemed to him
that this was a task beyond his powers but perseverance
conquers all obstacles, and when it
was done he threw some leaves over the earth
that was scattered around, put the branches back
in their place and then he was tired enough to
sit down; but there was still one thing that remained
to be done. The contents of Peleg’s valise
had to be returned, and when this was done,
without any reference being made to the order in
which his underwear was placed, and his spade
and pick-ax had been brought under the lean-to
and the ax hidden away in the bushes, Nat was
ready to sit down and draw a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“Hail Columbia, happy land!” said he to
himself. “It is better to be born lucky than
rich. There must be as much as thirty or forty
thousand dollars in those bags. It is mine, Mr.
Nickerson told me that he had no kith or kin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
to leave it to, and I will die before I will give it
up. I am quite willing that anybody should come
in here and go all over the woods, and if he did
not see me hide the money he will have his trouble
for his pains.”</p>

<p>While this thought was passing through
his mind he heard a sudden rattling in the bushes
behind him, and before he could start to his
feet to see who it was, the branches parted and
Jonas Keeler’s forbidding face came through.
The face, half hidden by thick, bushy whiskers,
did not look much as it did when Nat last saw
him. There was an eager expression upon it,
and his hands trembled so that he could scarcely
take his rifle down from his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, we have found you at last,” said
Jonas, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Yes sir, you have found me at last,” repeated
Nat, sinking back upon his bed of boughs
again.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the bushes parted again
and Caleb came out. He seemed more eager than
his father was. He looked all around to make sure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
that there was no one else present, and then
walked into the camp as though he had a right to.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness here’s a gun,” said he,
and the tenderness with which he picked up his
single barrel and looked it carefully over, would
have led one to believe that it was worth money.
“Did you see anything to shoot with it?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nat. “The woods were perfectly
quiet last night.”</p>

<p>“Now, Nat, let us come to business at once,”
said Jonas setting his rifle down by the side of a
tree and pushing back his sleeve. “Where is the
money that you have come here to dig up?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Two Brave Hunters.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Ghosts,”</span> said Jonas Keeler, leaning his
back against the side of the barn and
crossing his legs. “I didn’t know that
there was any around here, although we used to
hear and see plenty of them down in Pike County
where I lived when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“Where did you go to find them, pap?”
asked Caleb, who seemed to be deeply interested
in what his father had to say.</p>

<p>“We didn’t go anywhere to see them. They
generally came to us, and they came, too, just
when we didn’t want to see them. We
used to find them in grave-yards; and now and
then they would come into our barns and houses.
What did they do to you, Peleg? You need not
be afraid to speak of them here, because there
ain’t no ghosts about.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>“They didn’t do anything to me,” answered
Peleg, “cause why, I got afraid and dug out.”</p>

<p>Peleg had been looking for a place to sit
down, and when nothing else offered he sat down
on the floor of the barn and drew his feet under
him. His story was a long one and immensely
thrilling. He said that he and Nat did not hear
anything out of the ordinary until they came to
Manchester, and then the storekeeper put them
on their guard. He told about the queer things
he had heard while going through the bushes,
and then he came to the strange words Nat had
used&mdash;“Here I am and there I am” until Jonas
began to look wild. But when he came to the
tree on the hillside which dropped its boughs
when Nat called upon him, Jonas’s face, which
had thus far betrayed the deepest interest, suddenly
gave away to a smile, and he finally threw
his head back against the barn and broke out into
a violent laugh.</p>

<p>“Now I will tell you what’s the fact; it is
the truth and nothing else,” stammered Peleg,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
who was lost in wonder. “I saw it with my own
eyes.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you did,” said Jonas, wiping his
eyes to get rid of the tears that held to them.
“But don’t you know that that was the sign of
falling weather? If you don’t, you have lived in
this country a good while for nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I tell him,” said Mr. Graves.
“He has got so interested in the ghosts that he
is willing to believe he sees ghosts in everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I have to say is, let them that
think differently go down there and stay all
night,” said Peleg. “I won’t do it for no man’s
money.”</p>

<p>“Did Nat feel afraid when you spoke of
the ghosts?” asked Jonas.</p>

<p>“Naw. That boy ain’t afraid of anything.
He even called after me when I started for home
to come back again, but I didn’t go.”</p>

<p>“Caleb, have you got them cows milked?”
asked Jonas, getting upon his feet. “Then you
had better stir your stumps and we will go in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
and get some breakfast. It is after grub time
now, and I begin to feel hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jonas, what are you going to do?”
inquired Mr. Graves, who somehow took this as a
gentle hint that he had got through with their
conversation. “Are you going down there to
see about that money?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Jonas; whereupon Caleb, who
had gathered up a milk-bucket, turned and looked
at him with mouth and eyes wide open. “There
ain’t no money there. When Nat gets tired of
looking for it he will come back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graves acted as though he wanted to say
something else, but Jonas picked up a fork and
began tossing about the fodder and paid no further
attention to him. He waited a minute or
two, then motioned to Peleg, put his rifle on his
shoulder and went out. Jonas continued tossing
about the fodder until they were well on their
way to the house, and then stood the fork up
where it belonged and called to Caleb in a whisper:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>“Say; do you believe all that boy said about
ghosts?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you?” said Caleb in surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. There may be some down
there&mdash;I ain’t disputing that; but Nat never used
words to help him look for that money. Say, I
am going down there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pap!” was all Caleb could say in reply.</p>

<p>“I am, and if there is money there, I will
bet you he has found it.”</p>

<p>“But, pap, you said there wasn’t any there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see I said that just to keep old
man Graves and his boy at home? Hurry up
and milk them cows and I will hitch up the
horse.”</p>

<p>“Are you going with the wagon?”</p>

<p>“Course. It is easier to ride than it is to
walk, and the first thing we know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Must I go with you?” said Caleb, almost
ready to drop.</p>

<p>“Of course you are. I can’t go alone; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
think of the money we will have when we come
back!”</p>

<p>“Well, pap, you can go and I’ll stay here.
It ain’t safe to go. Peleg has been down there
and he said he would not go again for no man’s
money. I’ve got a heap of work to do&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, Caleb, you just shut up about the
work you’ve got to do,” said Jonas angrily.
“You will have to go with me and that is all
about it. If Nat is not afraid of the ghosts, why
should you be?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you know how good Nat was to
the old man when he was alive. If I had been
that way, I could have gone, too.”</p>

<p>Jonas evidently did not hear this last remark
of Caleb’s, for he seized the harness and
went in to fix up the horse which did not look able
to travel twenty miles to save his life. But then
that was the way that Jonas’s stock all looked.
In a few minutes he had the harness on and led
him out of the barn to hitch him to the wagon.
It was just at this time that Mr. Graves and his
party were going outside the bars and his wife
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
was coming down the walk to meet him. She
was coming with long strides, too, as if she had
something on her mind.</p>

<p>“Say, Jonas,” said she, as soon as she was
near enough to make him hear.</p>

<p>“Well, say it yourself,” retorted Jonas.
“I know all about it. I am going down to old
man Nickerson’s woods, me and Caleb are, and
we are going to have that money. Have you
anything to say against it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jonas, don’t you know that there are
ghosts down there?” said Mrs. Keeler, almost
ready to believe that the man had taken leave of
his senses to propose such a thing.</p>

<p>“Then that’s what his wife stopped in the
house for,” said Jonas, and he shouted out the
words so that Mr. Graves could hear them.
“What does she know about ghosts? Now I
heard all Peleg’s story, and I listened to it as
though I believed it; but if Nat is down there and
can stay there all night without the ghosts troubling
him, why can’t other people do it, too?
There ain’t no ghosts there.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>“Do you really think so, Jonas?”</p>

<p>“I know it. You see by going with the
horse we’ll get there in the daytime, and everybody
knows that ghosts can’t hurt you then. I
will make him get that money and then me and
you will have good times.”</p>

<p>“But maybe Nat won’t do it. He would be
a fule to tell you where that money is hidden.”</p>

<p>Jonas was by this time engaged in hitching
one of the traces to the whiffletree of the wagon.
He stopped in his work, leaned against his horse
which did not seem able to bear any weight but
his own, and put his hands into his pockets.</p>

<p>“That boy is a plumb dunce if he is going
down there to find that money and then give it
up to you, who didn’t do the first thing toward
helping him,” continued Mrs. Keeler.</p>

<p>“What’s the reason Nat won’t give up the
money to me?” demanded Jonas.</p>

<p>“Because you won’t have your switch
handy.”</p>

<p>“I have my knife in my pocket, and I tell
you that switches are as handy down there in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
woods as they be up here,” said Jonas, once
more turning to his work. “What did that old
woman Graves have to say to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she told the awfulest stories of what
Peleg had seen,” said Mrs. Keeler, moving up to
be a little closer to her husband. “She told about
the heads and horns coming out of the bushes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She made that all up out of her own head,”
interrupted Jonas, who became angry again.
“Peleg did not see anything, because if he had,
Nat would have become frightened, too. Now is
breakfast ready? I am just crazy to be on my
way to them woods. When you see us coming
back, you can just take them old caliker gowns
of yours and bundle them into the fire. You
won’t have any more use for them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Keeler tried to look pleased at this, but
somehow or other she could not help thinking
of the work Jonas would have to do before she
could take those “caliker gowns” and tumble
them into the fire. But she did not say any more
for she knew it would be useless. She led the
way toward the house to get breakfast ready, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Jonas followed with the wagon. Caleb came
along presently with the milk, and he was the
most sober one in the lot. He knew better than
to refuse to go with his father, for there was
that switch down in the barn. It had not been
brought into use since his father threatened to
apply it to Nat for saying that he would not give
up the shoes he had purchased, and Caleb did
not want to see it brought out for his benefit.</p>

<p>Jonas was evidently not at ease during
breakfast, for he talked incessantly about the
money which he knew was there, and the way he
was going to induce Nat to show it to him.</p>

<p>“Just let me touch that switch to him once
and see how quick he will run to that place where
the money is hidden,” said Jonas, with an approving
wink at his son. “He will go so fast that
you can’t see him for the dust. If he don’t do
it, I have another thing that will get next to him.
I’ll tie him up and leave him there in the woods
without a bite to eat or a drop to drink, and see
how long he will be in coming to his senses.”</p>

<p>The breakfast being over there was nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
to detain them. Caleb got up and took down his
father’s rifle which he closely examined. With
that in his hands he was pretty sure that he could
fight his way with any ghost that came in his
path.</p>

<p>“Put a double charge of powder in there and
two bullets,” said Jonas. “That’s the way I
come it over a deer, and I will bet you if one of
them ghosts gets those balls in his head&mdash;Well,
he will be a dead ghost, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You will let me carry the rifle, won’t you?”
said Caleb.</p>

<p>“No, I reckon I had best carry it myself and
you do the driving,” said Jonas, stretching out
his hand for the weapon. “You can drive that
old horse a heap faster than I can, and if I see
one of those horns stuck out from the bushes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, Jonas, don’t talk that way,” whined
Mrs. Keeler, casting uneasy glances about the
room. “There may be one of them here now.”</p>

<p>“Naw, there ain’t. There ain’t no ghosts in
the world. If you are ready Caleb, jump in.
You will see us somewhere about sun-down.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Jonas went ahead to lower the bars so that
the wagon could drive through, and then, paying
no further attention to his wife, he climbed to his
seat, and Caleb cracked the whip and drove off.</p>

<p>“Hit the old fellow and make him go
faster,” said Jonas. “We must get there by
sun up, and have plenty of time to do the work
besides. If we don’t, we have got to come home
in the dark.”</p>

<p>This was all the encouragement that Caleb
needed to make him keep up a tremendous beating
of the horse all the way to Manchester. The
horse suffered and did his best, but he did not
seem to carry them over the miles very rapidly;
but at length, to Caleb’s immense relief, the village
appeared in sight. Of course the travelers
were hungry and the horse needed watering, and
so they drew up before the store at which Nat
had purchased his things. Of course, too, the
storekeeper knew them; he knew everybody within
a circle of twenty miles around, and greeted
them very cordially.</p>

<p>“Well, if there ain’t Jonas,” said he, briskly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
“Are you going up to the woods to see how
Nat is getting on? He was in here an hour or so
ago, but I don’t see what he got those things for.
He told me that he was going to look at some timber,
and he bought a pick-ax and spade. Now
what is he going to do with them?”</p>

<p>This was the same man who had waited on
Nat when he was in the store, and he was determined
to find out what those digging implements
were to be used for. The customer whom he had
consulted, was outside attending to some necessary
business and getting a team ready to go up
to Mr. Nickerson’s woods and find out, but he
looked upon Jonas’s coming as a most fortunate
thing, and he hoped that by some adroit questioning
he could learn something; but he soon gave it
up as a bad job.</p>

<p>“Now the boy doesn’t want a pick-ax and
spade to find timber with, does he?” continued
the storekeeper. “He must be going to dig in
the ground with them, and I would like to know
what he is after. He said he was going to repair
some fences; but I did not believe it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“Give me ten cents’ worth of crackers and
ten cents’ worth of cheese,” said Jonas, who
wanted to get a little time to think about this matter.
“I believe we are going to have falling
weather before long.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it now,” said the man, hurrying
to fulfill Jonas’s order. “We need rain badly.
What did you say Nat wanted that spade and
pick-ax for?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; he is going to fix some fences, and
of course he needs a spade to get the blocks in
right,” said Jonas, who had been doing some tremendous
thinking while the storekeeper was getting
out his crackers and cheese. “I am going
up to look at him and see that he does his work
right Yes, the old man is dead,” said he, in reply
to a question. “And if I can pay the tax
rates on this place I shall have it.”</p>

<p>“Did he leave you anything?” asked the
storekeeper. “I suppose that is what you are
looking out for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should look for that
more’n anything else,” said Jonas, in a tone of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
voice that showed the storekeeper that he did not
care to answer any more questions on this point.
“The money was his own, and he left it to whom
he pleased.”</p>

<p>Having secured his crackers and cheese and
the horse having drunk all he could, Jonas and
Caleb climbed into the wagon again and continued
on their way. At this moment the customer
drove up with a team.</p>

<p>“It is no go, Eph,” said the storekeeper.
“That’s Jonas in that wagon. He did not say
anything about money, but I will tell you what I
think: If the old man has left any money, he has
got it hidden up there in the woods. Let us wait
until the boy comes down here and then go for
him.”</p>

<p>“It beats the world how everybody seems to
think that the old man had left us some money,”
said Jonas, as plainly as a mouthful of cracker
would permit. “Everyone seems to think that
the old man had money, and I believe he had, too.
And it all rests with Nat. If he’s found it I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
going to know where it is. Hit him hard, Caleb,
and make him go faster.”</p>

<p>The six miles that lay between them and the
village seemed to have lengthened out wonderfully,
but the old horse finally covered the distance
at last and drew up at the place where the
boys had crossed the fence to enter the bushes.
There had been somebody through there, that
was plain; but Caleb’s eyes grew wild when he
looked at the dark masses of brush that lay before
him; and even Jonas was not quite so lively
as he had been.</p>

<p>“I tell you it is mighty dark in there,” said
the elder, getting his rifle into shape for instant
shooting. “Go ahead, Caleb.”</p>

<p>“Now I won’t do it,” said Caleb, seizing his
father’s arm and trying to push him toward the
fence. “Give me the gun and I’ll go.”</p>

<p>But that gun was something that Jonas did
not want to part with. He felt safe when he had
that weapon, and that was more than could be
said if Caleb had charge of it.</p>

<p>“Well, stay right close behind me and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
nobody can hurt you,” said Jonas, speaking two
words for himself and one for Caleb. “Don’t
run away. The best way to fight these ghosts is
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, pap, you say there isn’t any,” Caleb
reminded him.</p>

<p>“Now I don’t believe there is; but it is well
to be on the safe side. Come on, now.”</p>

<p>It was hard work for Jonas to screw up his
courage to cross the fence, but he finally did it
at last. As soon as he was safe in the bushes
Caleb scrambled after him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>The Rabbit’s Foot.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Jonas</span> and Caleb found it a hard task to work
their way through those thick bushes toward
the back end of Mr. Nickerson’s dooryard.
There had been a path in former times,
but it had been used so very seldom of late that
the briers and branches had grown over it until
it was pretty nearly obstructed. Caleb listened
for the queer sounds that Peleg had heard while
going through there, but nothing attracted his
attention and he began to believe that there was
nothing unusual in there. Jonas worked his
way ahead without saying anything, and finally
pushed the last bush aside and sprang out in full
view of Nat’s camp. He cast his eager eyes
around to see if any of the money had been dug
up, but he could see nothing of it. Nat looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
just like a hunter who was enjoying a rest after
a long day in the woods.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, we have found you at last,” were
the first words Jonas uttered. “Now where is
the money that you have come to dig up?”</p>

<p>“What money?” inquired Nat, slowly rising
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Aw! What money?” shouted Jonas, going
under the lean-to, catching up Peleg’s valise and
shaking it to be sure that there was no money in
it. “I mean that money you have come here to
dig up&mdash;the money that old man Nickerson hid
here during the war; the money that you have
been drawing on to buy him tobacco? Where is
it?”</p>

<p>“You have the camp and you see everything
that is to be seen,” said Nat. “Where the money
is I don’t know. Yes, I do know,” he added to
himself. “But I am going to keep it to myself.”</p>

<p>“Whoo-pee!” said Jonas again. “Did you
come down here for nothing? I know you didn’t;
and I must know where that money is and all
about it, or there will be the worst whipped boy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
here in these woods that you ever heard tell of.
Once more and for the last time, I ask you where
it is.”</p>

<p>“You can just look around and find it for
yourself,” replied Nat, who, by gradually working
his way around, had succeeded in getting between
Jonas and the bushes. “If Mr. Nickerson
left any money I don’t know where it is. He
would not leave it up here in the woods for it to
rot all away and do nobody any good.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think he would do that. He
thought too much of a dollar to waste it in that
way; but he could leave it up here in the woods
and tell you where to find it when he was through
with it. Now, Nat, where is it? Tell me, honor
bright, and I will give you half of it; I will, so
sure as I stand here.”</p>

<p>“You must look around and find it, for I
don’t know where it is,” replied Nat; and the expression
on his face showed that he was in earnest
in his decision to keep the hiding place of the
money all to himself. “If you find it you can
have it all.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet you I do, and you will go without
shoes and clothes this winter,” said Jonas, slipping
his hand into his pocket and looking around
at the trees as if he were searching for a switch.
“I made you an offer and you won’t take it, and
now I will look for myself; but first you are going
to have something to remember that offer by.
What do you find there, Caleb?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothing in Peleg’s valise because
I have looked all through it,” replied Caleb.
“But here is something I can’t see into.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he passed the spade over to his
father, running his fingers through some dirt that
still adhered to it.</p>

<p>“That spade has been used since it came up
here, and if it could speak it would tell you something
about the money,” continued Caleb. “He
has dug it up and hid it away in another place.”</p>

<p>“Caleb, you are right” said Jonas, examining
the spade. “Now where is it? Caleb, you
just keep an eye on him while I cut a switch. I
will bet you that he will tell all about it in less’n
five minutes.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>“I can’t tell you about a thing that I don’t
know,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“No; but you only think you have forgotten.
A switch has a big means of starting one’s intellect,
and when you see that swinging over your
head, you will think faster than you do now.”</p>

<p>“Pap, I believe we are onto the track of the
money at last,” said Caleb, who seemed to have
forgotten all about the ghosts. “Lay it onto him
good fashion, and we’ll go back home&mdash;by gracious!
I wouldn’t take ten dollars for my chance.”</p>

<p>The words seemed to encourage Jonas, who
presently pulled down a big bough and began to
cut it loose. It was a large limb, larger than the
one he would have taken to beat his horse with,
and while he used his knife upon it, Caleb slipped
around until he got on the outside of Nat, that is
between him and the bushes, and stood regarding
him with a smile of intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit me with that thing,” said Nat,
suddenly straightening up until he seemed to
grow larger and stronger than Caleb had ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
seen him look before. “If you do you will at
ways regret it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I won’t hit you with it,” said
Jonas, with a sort of laugh that sounded more
like the growl of an enraged animal. “I’ll just
wear you out with it unless you tell me what has
been going on here and all about it. You know
where that money is, and I am going to find out
before I let you go. You hear me?”</p>

<p>There was something about Nat that did not
look exactly right to Caleb. He thought that his
father had undertaken a bigger job than he could
accomplish by endeavoring to force the boy to
tell where his money was hidden, and if he could
work it some way so as to get “upon Nat’s blind
side” and coax him to tell what he wanted to
know, why the way would be so much the easier
for them. He resolved to try it, but he did not
have time to try it all.</p>

<p>“Come now, Nat, you see how pap is going
to lick you, don’t you?” said he. “Now tell me
where the money is and you will get off scott free.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Come now, Nat. Me and you has always been the
best of friends&mdash;”</p>

<p>What else Caleb was going to say he did
not have time to say it, that is while he was
standing erect. The place on which Nat was
standing was suddenly vacant, Caleb’s left arm
received a wrench and his foot a trip, and both
of them sent him headlong into the bushes. A
moment afterward Nat dashed into the bushes
and was out of sight in an instant.</p>

<p>“By gum!” said Caleb, slowly raising himself
upon his elbow and gazing in the direction
Nat had taken. “Pap, he has got away.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” exclaimed Jonas, who being concealed
from view of the boys had not seen Nat
when he made his bold dash for freedom. “Has
he run away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he has run away; and he throwed
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jonas came around the tree and found that
Nat was not there. He glanced all around in
every direction but the boy he had hoped to try
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
the switch upon was somewhere else. Caleb was
just crawling to his feet.</p>

<p>“And did you stand there and let him go?”
demanded Jonas, and he half raised the switch as
if he had a mind to lay it over Caleb’s shoulders.
“Why didn’t you stop him?”</p>

<p>“You might as well try to stop a hurricane
as to stop that fellow,” said Caleb, holding one
hand to his elbow. “I never saw a boy go so before.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, catch him; catch him,” shouted
Jonas. “Which way did he go?”</p>

<p>“Out there among the bushes; and pap, I
just ain’t a-going in there after him. Maybe he’ll
get those ghosts on his side.”</p>

<p>Jonas, who had been on the point of rushing
into the bushes in pursuit of Nat, stopped when
he heard those words and pulled off his hat and
dashed it upon the ground at his feet. Then
Caleb saw that his father was afraid of ghosts
as he was himself. It was only his desire to possess
the money that had induced him to come
there. Caleb stood holding fast to his elbow and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
waiting to see what he was going to do about it.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone such luck!” said Jonas.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I say,” replied Caleb.
“Why did not the old man leave his money to you
or mam like he had oughter do? Now nobody
won’t get it.”</p>

<p>“Nobody except that miserable Nat,” sputtered
Jonas. “I have a good notion to use the
switch on you for letting him go.”</p>

<p>“Well, pap, you would not make anything
by that. I was talking to him like a Dutch uncle,
and the first thing I knew I was flat on my back,
and he was just going out of sight. I did not hear
anything of him from the time he struck the
bushes. Do you hear him now?”</p>

<p>Jonas listened but all the sound he heard was
the chirping of birds and the faint sough of the
wind as the breeze swept through the bushes.
Everything was as still as a graveyard; it seemed
too still for the woods. Jonas listened for a moment
and then gathered up his hat and put it on
his head.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” whispered Caleb. “This
ain’t no place for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking of,” said
Jonas, in the same cautious whisper. “Let’s take
everything he has got in his lean-to and dig out.
We shall have to hurry because it will be dark before
we reach home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in taking Peleg’s valise and
gun back to him,” observed Caleb. “He brought
them out here and he can take them back.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is so,” said Jonas, who was busy
picking up the spade and pick-ax and such provisions
as he could find. “But in the present opportunity
we want Peleg and his pap to believe
that we were here. We have got a fearful story
to tell when we go back, and we want them to believe
us.”</p>

<p>“That is so, too; but, pap, we won’t go back
through the bushes, will we?”</p>

<p>“Not much we won’t,” exclaimed Jonas, as
if he were surprised at the mere mention of such
a thing. “Nat’s in there, and who knows but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
what he has got some of the ghosts to help him
along?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you that is just what he did,” said
Caleb, dropping the armful of things which he
had gathered up. “I did not hear hide nor hair
of him after he got into the bushes.”</p>

<p>Father and son were not long in picking up
the things that were scattered about the lean-to
(they did not find the ax because that was concealed
in the bushes), and with them in their
hands they beat a hasty retreat from the camp,
following the course that Peleg had pursued
when he was there on a former occasion. They
reached the bars, stopping now and then to cast
furtive glances behind them, and when they got
fairly into the road their courage began to return
to them.</p>

<p>“I will tell you just what is the matter with
us,” said Jonas. “We have not got a rabbit’s
foot between us.”</p>

<p>“I do think in my soul that that’s what’s the
matter,” said Caleb, stopping short and looking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
at his father. “Do you reckon that Nat has one
of them?”</p>

<p>Now a rabbit’s foot is something that is held
in high esteem by the negroes at the South, and
by some of the white people, too. Whenever you
kill a rabbit, take one of the feet off and put it
into your pocket; or, if you are already provided
for in that respect, take the foot and give it to
some one who has not got any. Thus equipped
you are free from every danger. Ghosts can not
disturb you, and if you have to pass a graveyard
or a house that is haunted after dark, it will see
you safely through. Beyond a doubt this was
what was the matter with Jonas and his son.
They had thought of their rabbit’s feet when it
was too late to be of service to them. They were
kept at home on the mantle piece, snugly stowed
away so that they could be seized at a moment’s
warning, and they had come away and never
thought a word about them.</p>

<p>“Now did anybody ever hear of such luck?”
said Jonas, in disgust. “I have a rabbit’s foot
and so have you; and by leaving them at home is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
what has beaten us. We will go down there to-morrow
or next day and see what luck we shall
have.”</p>

<p>“Do you reckon that Nat has one of them!”
repeated Caleb, who was greatly relieved to know
what it was that had brought them such ill luck.
“Of course he had, or he never could have called
upon them ghosts to help him.”</p>

<p>“Dog-gone such luck,” repeated Jonas, who
kept turning this matter over in his mind. “He
wouldn’t go away and leave his rabbit’s foot behind
when he was engaged in such business,
would he? I tell you I am going to keep it in my
pocket wherever I go. It ain’t safe to be without
it.”</p>

<p>It was a long way by the road to the place
where they had left their horse, and every step of
the way they looked at the bushes fearful that
Nat would come out at them accompanied by one
or more of the ghosts. When they reached the
wagon Jonas climbed in without any words, leaving
Caleb to turn the horse around, and to take
care of his rifle which he hastily handed to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>“I think I will drive going back,” said he,
“He is going toward home now, and perhaps I
can make him step pearter than you did.”</p>

<p>Caleb saw through his father’s little trick,
but he gave in to it without saying a word. He
was going to have the handling of the rifle now,
and he breathed a good deal easier as he clutched
the weapon and seated himself on the seat beside
Jonas. He did not care if Nat had three or four
ghosts to back him up. He was a sure shot with a
gun, and he was certain that there would be one
ghost less in the country should one show himself.</p>

<p>The old horse stepped out wonderfully under
the new driver, and it was not long before Jonas’s
courage all came back to him and he could talk
about what happened there in Mr. Nickerson’s
dooryard without shouting himself hoarse.</p>

<p>“That there is what’s the matter with us,
Caleb,” said he, turning on his seat and greeting
him with an approving wink. “It beats the
world, as long as I have lived in this country,
that I did not think of that rabbit’s foot before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
I left home. But we will try them again some
day&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It has got to be pretty soon too, pap,” interrupted
Caleb. “Nat has seen that money already.
He has got it hidden somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” said Jonas, “or
else how come that dirt on his spade? And to
think we had to give it up just on account of not
having that rabbit’s foot! These little things
sometimes make big changes in our affairs, Caleb?”</p>

<p>Caleb must have thought of this matter all
the way home, but he breathed a little easier when
the ancestral roof came in sight. His mother
was there and she came down to the bars to lower
them. As the tired old horse entered the yard
she looked at Jonas, but the latter shook his head
in a most discouraging manner.</p>

<p>“I just knew how it would be,” said she.</p>

<p>“And just on account of leaving that rabbit’s
foot behind,” said Caleb.</p>

<p>“I noticed them, and I had a good notion to
holler at you and tell you to take them with you,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
said Mrs. Keeler. “But I supposed that you
knew what you were doing.”</p>

<p>None of the family said anything more until
they had got to the barn and turned the horse
out, and fed him with a handful of grass, and
then Jonas seated himself on a bucket, which he
turned upside down, and gave his wife a full history
of the events that had happened to them
since they went away in the morning; that is he
had the groundwork of truth for its foundation,
but there was many a little item which he put in
that occurred to him as he went along. Whenever
he touched upon anything which his wife found
it hard to believe, he always appealed to Caleb,
and the latter never failed to corroborate all he
said.</p>

<p>“And do you think that he got those spirits
to help him when he went into the bushes?” asked
Mrs. Keeler.</p>

<p>“He did; else why didn’t he make some noise
while he was going through them?” asked Jonas,
in reply. “He went along as still as a bird on the
wing. It was of no use for anybody to try to follow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
him. Well, that is once we failed, but the
next time we will fight him with his own weapons.
Caleb, don’t you forget those two rabbits’
feet the next time we go.”</p>

<p>“You bet I won’t,” replied Caleb.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>The Storekeeper in Action.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Nat’s</span> heart was in his month because he
did not believe he could escape from
Jonas, and Caleb so easily. The noise he
necessarily made in running through the bushes
would naturally guide them in the pursuit, and
Jonas was noted for his lightness of foot, and
Caleb also, for that matter. But it was now or
never. The switch was being prepared for him,
and in a few minutes more he would feel the full
weight of Jonas’s arm; and that it would fall by
all his strength, Nat did not doubt in the least.</p>

<p>“Here goes,” said Nat, to himself. “If I
fail they can’t any more than whip me, and if I
get away&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nat did not wait to finish all the sentence
that was in his mind. He bounded from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
place as if he had been set upon springs, a short
skirmish with Caleb who was overturned as easily
as a child, and he was safe in the bushes which
closed up behind him, and the twigs in his path
seemed to give away before him on their own accord.
He ran down the path with all the speed
he could command, jumped as far to the left as he
could and stretched himself out flat on the ground
and waited to see what was going to happen. By
the merest accident he lay down not ten feet from
his camp, and consequently he was within full
hearing of their voices while they remained there.</p>

<p>“By gum!” said Caleb, slowly, as he picked
himself up from the bushes into which he had
been thrown. “Pap, he has got away.”</p>

<p>He heard Jonas when he came around the
trees and knew when he raised the switch intending
to use it on Caleb for not keeping guard over
Nat. He listened in the hope that Caleb would
feel the full force of that switch, for he had a long
account against him and he did not think that any
blow he could have received would have been
amiss.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>“He has got my shoes,” said Nat to himself,
and it was all that he could do to refrain from
speaking the words outright. “Give him a few
good licks to pay him for that.”</p>

<p>But we know that Jonas did not use the
switch upon Caleb, but talked with him about
other matters. He knew when they examined the
spade again to find the dirt upon it, but all
thoughts that they would pursue him were turned
into another channel by Caleb’s request: “Let
us go home. This is no place for us.” But there
was another fear that came over him just then.
They were going home, but they intended to remove
everything there was in his camp, provisions
and all, and leave Nat to get along as best
he could.</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ve got my money in my
hat,” said Nat, pulling off the article in question
and feeling of his roll of bills. “And even if he
robs me, what harm will it do? I have some more
money stowed away, and it is where nobody can
find it.”</p>

<p>Nat lay there in his concealment and waited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
patiently for Jonas and Caleb to get through with
picking up the articles they wanted to take with
them and leave the camp. He knew they would
not come back through the bushes, but would go
across the field and so steer clear of them. He
drew a long breath of relief, and finally raised
himself upon his knees as they passed out of the
ravine, but still he did not think it wise to show
himself until the creaking of wheels, loudly proclaiming
their need of wagon grease, was heard,
slowly at first, then increasing in volume as the
horse responded to the whip, and when it had
died away entirely he got upon his feet and made
his way back to the camp. Everything that could
have been of use to him had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Now the next thing will be something else
and what shall it be?” said Nat, throwing himself
upon his bed of boughs and turning the matter
over in his mind. “I can’t live without something
to eat&mdash;that is plain enough to be seen; and
I don’t know about going down to Manchester for
more grub. Of course somebody there saw Jonas
when he came through, and what kind of an excuse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
will I make for coming back there after more
provisions! I have told so many lies lately that
I want to keep out of it now, if I can.”</p>

<p>For ten minutes Nat laid there trying to
make up his mind what to do, and then got up
prepared for action. He wanted to see where he
had left his money, and then he would go on to
Manchester and be governed by circumstances.
If Jonas had not stopped there to converse upon
his object of going to old man Nickerson’s fields,
well and good. He would purchase some new
clothes, the first he had ever owned, enough crackers
and cheese to last him on his way to St Louis,
come back to his camp after dark, secure his
money, and then the place which had known him
so long would know him no more forever. When
be was away among strangers and nobody knew
who he was, he would be ready to begin his life
over again.</p>

<p>“That is what I will do,” said Nat, wending
his way up the hill. “My first thing must be to
get some new clothes, or when I come to put that
money in the bank they will think right away that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
I have stolen it, and there will be more trouble for
me. I should not dare to send for anyone here
to prove who I am, for they would turn me out
the biggest rascal upon earth, so that they could
get the money; so what should I do? By George!
I am not out of trouble yet.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Nat arrived beside the log
under which he had buried Mr. Nickerson’s
money, or rather he called it his own money now,
and everything looked just as it did when he left
there. No one had been near it. He threw some
more bushes over the place, kicked some leaves
around it and then set out for Manchester. He
felt his responsibility and it is not right to say
that he carried a light heart beneath his jacket,
for he did not. He began to see that there was
a big difference in wishing for money and having
it. He found that it was some trouble to take
care of his treasure.</p>

<p>He shortly reached the road near the spot
where Jonas and Caleb had left their horse, but
there was no one in sight. He climbed over the
fence and kept on his way, looking neither to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
right hand nor the left, so impatient was he to
reach his journey’s end, and finally he stood in
the store where he had been several times before;
but he did not know what those two men in the
back part of the store were talking about. They
looked up as Nat entered, and instantly a smile
overspread their faces and one of them hastened
forward to greet him.</p>

<p>“Well, if here ain’t that smart looking boy
again I don’t want a cent,” said he, and he was
so pleased to see Nat that he laughed all over.
“Say, Jonas and Caleb have just been here, and
I would like to know what made them leave in
such a hurry. They did not see any ghosts, did
they!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nat, in disgust. “Have you
been treating them to some stories, too? They
left some work to do back at home, and went there
to attend to it. You scared one fellow out but
you can’t scare me out.”</p>

<p>“I never was so sorry for anything in my
life,” said the man. “I saw that Peleg could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
easily frightened, and so I started that ghost
story on him.”</p>

<p>“Have you got anything to eat in the store?”
asked Nat, who did not want to talk about the
ghosts any more. “They took away all the provisions
I had.”</p>

<p>“Of course we have,” said the man briskly.
“What do you want? Say. Did you find that
money you were looking for?”</p>

<p>“What money?” asked Nat, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, come Nat, there is no use of your trying
to play off on us in that style,” said the storekeeper;
and there was just a shade that darkened
his brow as if he were getting angry. “You went
up there to dig up some money, didn’t you,
now?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would give me those provisions
and let me go along back,” said Nat, who did not
much like the way the man eyed him. “I don’t
know anything about any money.”</p>

<p>“See here, Nat,” whispered the man, putting
his face close to the boy’s ear and holding his
arm, “if you will tell me where that money is&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t know anything about it,”
declared Nat, pulling away from the man’s grasp.
“If you don’t want to sell me some grub, I will
go elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Come with me; I want to see you,” whispered
the storekeeper, retaining his hold upon
Nat’s arm and drawing him toward a side door.</p>

<p>“Say what you have got to say right here,”
said Nat. “There is no secret about it. I dug
up no money while I was there, and I don’t care
who knows it.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want that everybody should
know what I am going to say to you,” urged the
man; and as if to add emphasis to his words he
seized the boy with both hands, fairly lifted him
from the floor, carried him through the side door
which closed behind him. “Now will you listen
to what I have to say to you?” he added, with a
wicked glitter in his eye. “I have got you now,
and here you are going to stay as long as I want
you.”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and the customer
came in. He, too, was in the plot if such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
it could be called, for he evinced no surprise at
what he saw.</p>

<p>“Is the way all clear?” asked the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes; there is no one on the streets,” replied
the customer. “Now what be you going to do
with him?”</p>

<p>“We’ll take him back in the storeroom and
shut him up there,” was the answer. “What do
you think of that, my boy? There you will wait
until you are ready to reply to such questions as
I ask you, with a big bull dog to keep an eye on
you. If you try to get out there won’t be anything
left of you in the morning.”</p>

<p>While the man was talking in this way he
was dragging rather than leading Nat toward the
back part of the store, and at last halted in front
of a door where he released him, and began
searching in his pockets to find the key. It was
dark in there, owing to the fact that there were
no windows to let in light upon the scene, and
when he found the key and inserted it into the
lock, a growl followed by a deep-toned bark came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
from the inside. The animal that uttered it must
have been fierce; that was easy enough to be
seen.</p>

<p>“Now you see what you’ll get if you try to
get away,” said the storekeeper, throwing open
the door. “I reckon you will think twice before
you come any of your tricks on Benny; hey, old
dog.”</p>

<p>Nat’s heart seemed to stop beating. If there
was anything in the world that he was afraid of
it was a savage dog. He looked at Benny, and
rightly concluded that “he would not come any
of his tricks” on that beast. He was the worst
looking dog that Nat had ever seen. He was
small, but he had an immense head, and his under
jaw stuck out so that his teeth could be plainly
seen. He was yellow all over except his head,
which was as black as if he had been painted,
and he was bob-tailed. He did not appear to be
gratified by this intrusion at all. He would hardly
get out of his way when the man pushed him
aside and pointed to a box and told Nat to sit
down there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t know anything about that
money,” said Nat, who was quite alarmed at the
idea of being shut in that room over night with
such a dog for a companion. “I will go up there
with you and help you dig for it; that is if you
think it is in the ground.”</p>

<p>“Of course we know it is in the ground or
else you wouldn’t need a spade and pick-ax to
throw it out with,” answered the storekeeper.
“You tell us where it is, and let us go up and dig
for it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you for I don’t know;” said
Nat.</p>

<p>“Very well; then you can stay here until you
find out,” said the man, fiercely. “When you
get so hungry and thirsty that you can’t stand it
any longer, you just yell and I will be around.
Will you tell us?”</p>

<p>“I have already answered your question until
I am tired of it,” said Nat, seating himself on
the box, with a determined look on his face. “If
I stay here until I die you won’t get anything else
out of me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” said the man, moving toward
the door. “We are going up right now to
look for it, and when we come back, perhaps we
will tell you how much we have made. Watch
him, Benny. Keep an eye on him, and if he goes
near that window, just take him down and serve
him the way you did that burglar that got into
the store last week.”</p>

<p>With this parting advice to his dog the storekeeper
went out followed by his customer, and
Nat heard the key as it grated harshly in the lock.
He sat perfectly still, he was afraid to do otherwise,
for, now that his eyes became somewhat
accustomed to the darkness, he could see that the
dog kept his position beside the door, and seemed
to be awaiting some move on his part. Once or
twice he licked his huge jaw as if he were tired of
waiting.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am in for it now,” said Nat,
running his eye along the wall as if he were looking
for that window of which the storekeeper had
spoken. “I would not be safer if I were shut up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
in jail. That dog&mdash;Whew! I don’t want anything
to do with him.”</p>

<p>The dog evidently knew what opinion Nat
cherished toward him, for after waiting in vain
for him to make some advances, he came over to
Nat and laid his chin upon his knee. Nat could
hardly keep from yelling when he saw the dog advancing
toward him, but when he reached the boy
and worked his nose as if he were trying to place
his hand upon his head, his heart gave a thrill
of delight.</p>

<p>“Well, by gum!” said Nat, unconsciously
making use of the same expression that Caleb had
used when Nat threw him headlong into the
bushes. “I believe the dog is friendly;” and he
raised his hand and placed it on the dog’s head.</p>

<p>Nat had never been more astonished in his
life. The dog’s appearance was against him;
but that was as far as it went. He was a good,
honest dog in reality, and seemed to sympathize
with Nat in his trouble.</p>

<p>“Benny, good Benny; I believe you are a
good dog yet,” said Nat, reaching down and patting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the animal on the side. Benny not only submitted
to it, but when he saw that Nat was about
to stop he worked his nose again as if he meant
him to continue. “I believe now that I will try
that window,” said Nat, a bright idea striking
him. “Since Benny is all right if I sit here, he
will be all right if I move around.”</p>

<p>Nat had by this time located the window, and
he arose from his box and moved toward it as
though he had a perfect right there. Benny
moved with him, and did not raise any objections
when Nat seized the staple with which the window
was fastened and exerted his strength to
open it. It was a heavy window, and was doubtless
used for passing in and out bulky goods that
would take up too much room in the store; but it
yielded to Nat’s muscle at last, and by pushing it
open a little way he let a flood of light into his
prison and could also see what there was outside.
He found that the opening gave entrance into a
kind of stable yard, bounded by a shed on one
side, and by pushing it open a little more, he saw
that on the other side it ran down to the street.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
His escape was now only the question of a few
minutes had he cared to leave at this time.</p>

<p>“Glory!” whispered Nat, closing and fastening
the shutter and stooping down to caress
Benny. “I dare not try it now, for fear that that
storekeeper may be on the watch; but when it
comes dark, we won’t stay in this house any
longer. Hail! Columbia happy land!”</p>

<p>Nat now felt at ease. He pulled off his hat,
felt of his roll of bills and then began to pat the
dog and talk to him. He had certainly determined
on one thing and that was to take the dog
with him. He had some money, how much he
did not know, and it would be the source of immense
relief to him to know that he had someone
whose looks would help him through.</p>

<p>“I will bet that there won’t be anybody pitch
into me to see what I have got with me, if he only
takes one look at you,” said Nat, stroking the
dog’s head. “I never had a dog take up with
me this way before. I tell you, Benny, you came
in just right.”</p>

<p>It must have been two o’clock by the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Nat was shut up in that room, so he had six or
seven hours of waiting to go through before the
storekeeper would come around again to see how
he felt over telling him where he had left that
money. There was one thing about it: He would
not tell him; he would die first He kept repeating
this resolution over and over again until the
sun went down, and it began to grow so dark in
his prison that he could not see his hand before
him. An hour passed, and then a key rattled in
the lock, the dog gave one of his tremendous barks
and took his stand in front of the door, which
presently opened admitting somebody, it was so
dark that he could not see a single feature on him.
But it was the storekeeper. He knew him as soon
as he spoke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Nat Wood, Gentleman.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Hi</span> there!” exclaimed the storekeeper, as he
threw open the door and stepped over
threshold. “Keeping watch over him
yet, ain’t you, Benny? I told you it wouldn’t be
safe for you to try to get away. Yes, here’s some
supper for you, Benny. Nat can’t have any until
he gets ready to talk to me. How do you come
on, Nat?”</p>

<p>“About as comfortably as I can, kept here in
the dark and with a savage dog for a companion,”
said Nat. “I wish you would take me
out where it is a little lighter.”</p>

<p>“I could not possibly think of it,” said the
man, with a laugh. “You think you are smart,
don’t you! We know where that money was hidden,
and we have been up there and got it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>It was lucky for Nat that the storekeeper had
come in there without a light, for the way these
words were spoken fairly took his breath away.
This was something that he had not bargained
for. He settled back on his box trying to find
something to lean against, and could not say anything
to save his life.</p>

<p>“What do you say to that, my boy?” asked
the man. “You did not know that we could find
that money without asking you, did you?”</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where did you find it?” stammered
Nat, suppressing his excitement, and it was all
he could do to utter the words.</p>

<p>“Oh, we found it under a tree where the old
man had left it,” said the storekeeper, carelessly.
“I tell you he must have gone down deep,
for we dug a trench there that was as deep as we
were.”</p>

<p>Nat straightened up again and drew a long
breath. If the storekeeper told the truth, he had
not yet found the money. He had not dug in the
place where it was concealed in the first instance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
because he did not say anything about the stone
which needed a lever to pry it out of its bed.</p>

<p>“Well, you have done more than I could
do,” said he, after thinking a moment. “You
have the money&mdash;How much did you get?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about fifteen or twenty thousand dollars,”
replied the man. “We were in such a
hurry that we didn’t stop to count it. But we
have enough to keep us without work as long as
we live.”</p>

<p>“Now what is to hinder you from turning me
loose?” asked Nat “I can’t do you any more
good by staying here.”</p>

<p>“I forgot to speak about that to my pardner,”
said the man, who was taken all aback
by this proposition. “And he has gone away and
I shan’t see him for a week.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to keep me here all that
time?”</p>

<p>“We might as well. You see we don’t want
you to go up and tell Jonas and Caleb about this
thing, for they might make us trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise you that I shall not go near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
Jonas and Caleb. I want to get as far away from
Manchester as I can. You might give me something
to eat, any way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will see what my pardner says
about it. If you keep still&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, your partner has gone away,” said
Nat.</p>

<p>“I mean when he comes back. It won’t take
you long to stay here a week. Now if you keep
still&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep me a whole week
without anything to eat?” asked Nat, in surprise.
“I can’t possibly live as long as that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe my pardner has not gone yet, and I
can speak to him. Now if you keep still, that dog
would not pester you; but if you get up and go to
roaming around, he’ll pin you. Then you won’t
tell me where the money is&mdash;humph!”</p>

<p>This was another evidence that the man had
not been near the place where the money was supposed
to be hidden. He came pretty near letting
the cat out of the bag that time. Nat did not say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
a word in reply. He wanted the man to believe
that he put faith in his story.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by. I shall not be in here before
to-morrow morning; and if you have anything to
say to me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What have I got to say? You have found
the money, and what more do you want?”</p>

<p>The man muttered something under his
breath that sounded a good deal like an oath by
the time it got to Nat’s ears, turned on his heel
and walked out, slamming the door after him.
Nat waited until the sound of his footsteps had
died away, then threw himself back on his box
and laughed silently to himself.</p>

<p>“If everybody is as big a fraud as that man,
my money is safe,” said he, rubbing his hands
together. “He has found the money, and yet he
wanted me to tell him where it was. Now, Benny,”
placing his hand upon the dog, which just
then came up and put his head upon his knee.
“We will wait until twelve o’clock, and then we
will start for Pond Post Office. I know it is a
small place but I reckon I can get some clothes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
there, and a couple of big valises that I can carry
my money in.”</p>

<p>The time now seemed longer to Nat than it
did before. He felt at his ease, and he longed to
be up and doing. Every minute that he lingered
in his prison-pen was just so much taken away
from the enjoyment of his money; and he fretted
and chafed over it. He wanted to get up and pace
the room in order to make the time pass more
rapidly away, but was checked by the thought
that the storekeeper might come back there and
listen at the door to see what he was doing, and
thus put it out of his power to escape by the window.</p>

<p>“If he hears me walking about he will know
that Benny and me are all right,” said Nat, “and
that will arouse his suspicions so that he will put
me somewhere else. I reckon I had best sit down
here on my box and wait for the hours to go by.”</p>

<p>A short time afterward, perhaps it was two
or three hours, he heard a faint rustling outside
the door, whereupon the dog left him and took up
his stand directly in front of it to see what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
going to happen. If it was the storekeeper and
he wanted to know what was going on in the
room, he had his trouble for his pains. Whatever
it was that made the noise outside it finally
ceased altogether and then everything was quiet.</p>

<p>This happened two or three times, and on
each occasion Nat was sure that he was being
watched; but every time the watcher went away
without hearing or seeing anything suspicious.
At last Nat heard some sounds coming from the
store which indicated that the proprietor was going
to shut up for the night; and then his heart
began to beat more rapidly. The time for action
was fast approaching. He heard the banging of
shutters, the goods which had been outside for inspection
during the day, were brought in and
stood up beside the counter, and finally the storekeeper’s
tread was heard outside the door. He
tried the lock and found that it was safe.</p>

<p>“Are you all right in there?” Nat heard him
inquire.</p>

<p>“As tight as you please,” answered Nat;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
“but in half an hour more I will be down the
road,” he added, to himself.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about that money
yet, I suppose?” said the man.</p>

<p>“How can I know anything about it when
you have got it?” asked Nat. “You have hidden
it away somewhere. The best thing you can do is
to take it up and clear yourself before I get out.”</p>

<p>“You are going to make trouble for me, are
you?” said the voice, angrily. “Well, if you get
tired of waiting for grub just let me know. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by. And it will be a long time before
you see me again,” said Nat mentally.</p>

<p>Nat knew when the storekeeper went out and
locked the door behind him, and then he heard
him go down the street. He knew that he did not
sleep in the building but his house lay at some
distance from the store, so the coast was clear at
last. He resolved to make the attempt at once,
being satisfied if he were well on the street it
would take a better man than the storekeeper to
overhaul him. It was but the work of a few seconds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
to go to the window and remove the hasp
with which it was confined. As the shutter
swung loose he found that the moon was shining
brightly and that the ten miles that lay between
him and Pond Post Office could be made easily as
it could by broad daylight.</p>

<p>“Come along, Benny,” said Nat placing
both hands upon the sill and springing up so
that all he had to do was to drop his legs outside.
“But maybe you don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>While Nat was talking about it he was free;
and he afterward said that he never felt anything
so good as he did when he found the solid
earth under his feet once more. The dog made
three attempts to follow him, but the window was
rather high and all he could do was to get his fore
feet upon the sill and each time he fell back making
more noise than was agreeable to Nat. The
next time he tried it Nat seized him by the thin
skin on the back of his neck, and in a moment
more he was standing by Nat’s side on the
ground. We say he was standing by Nat’s side;
but if the truth must be told, he was prancing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
around all over the ground as if he were overjoyed
at finding himself at liberty once more.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what’s the matter with you,”
said Nat, after he had looked carefully around
him and had drawn a bee-line for the bars that
led him out into the street. “You have been shut
up and deprived of your freedom so long that
you don’t know what to do with yourself when
you are let out. Well, you stick to me and I will
see that you are not shut up any more.”</p>

<p>Nat’s first impulse, when he found himself
outside the bars, was to strike up a whistle; but
before the first note had fairly left his lips he
caught his breath and looked all around to see if
there was anybody within hearing. The street
was silent and deserted; but that was no sign that
there was not somebody stirring in the houses by
which he passed so rapidly. He felt of his roll of
bills to make sure that he had it, and settled down
into a good fast walk, turning his head occasionally
to be certain that he was not followed. There
was one thing that Nat kept saying to himself:
“I have had a struggle for this fortune, and now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
that it is fairly within my grasp, nobody need
think that I am going to give it up. If I don’t
enjoy it, the money can stay there until it rots.”</p>

<p>The next thing that Nat had to decide upon
was, as he expressed it, something else. He was
free but his money was not free. The way to get
his fortune to St. Louis was what troubled him;
and he thought about it until he arrived within
sight of Pond Post Office. He began to feel
sleepy, too. It was then about two o’clock, so
that he had to wait for five long hours before the
single store of which the village could boast
would be open and ready for business. So he
climbed the fence, followed by the dog, found
himself a comfortable place under the protection
of a beech tree and stretched himself out and prepared
to go into the land of dreams. That would
have been considered a hard couch by some lads
who are raised in the city, but Nat had so long
been accustomed to hard things that he did not
mind it. He slept until the sun was well up, and
his dog kept watch over him.</p>

<p>“Now the next thing will be something to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
eat, Benny,” said Nat, pausing for a while in his
operations of smoothing down his hair to pat the
dog on the head. “I think you could eat a good
breakfast, don’t you? I tell you what we will do:
If they don’t have anything at the store worth
eating, we will go to someone’s house and ask for
a meal. I’ve got money to pay for it.”</p>

<p>Nat’s next duty was to take out his roll of
bills and select enough to pay for his clothes and
have a little left over for a bite to eat. When this
had been done he put the balance of the roll back
again, and the rest into his pocket where it would
come handy. Then he climbed the fence and
started for Pond Post Office again. He found
very few people stirring there but the groceryman
was up, and to him Nat at once addressed
himself.</p>

<p>“You look as though you had something to
eat here,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; that’s our business,” said the
man, smiling upon Nat. “Gracious! What a
horrid looking dog. Will he bite?”</p>

<p>“Not while I am around,” said Nat. “Have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
you got a suit of clothes! You see I need one
badly enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you did. I was looking
at your clothes when you came up. How big a
priced one do you want! We have some for $5.00
and some as high as $20.00.”</p>

<p>“Let me see a sorter of betwixt and between,”
said Nat, as he followed the man into the
store. “Something that will do to wear between
here and St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“Are you going as far as St Louis?” asked
the man, in amazement. “Then you want something
pretty nice. Now there’s a suit that will
jest suit you.”</p>

<p>Nat had never bought any clothes before,
and consequently he was rather awkward about
it. As far as he could see the clothes were well
made (the man took his measure around the chest
and of the length of his leg to make sure that they
would fit him) the price suited him and he took
them on the spot. Then he needed a couple of
shirts, two pairs of stockings and a pair of shoes
and a hat; all of which he took upon the man’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
recommendation, and so his trading was quickly
done.</p>

<p>“Now I wish to get a couple of valises to put
them into,” said Nat, looking around the store
and trying to select the articles in question.</p>

<p>“One’s going to be enough for you,” said
the man. “Now here is a valise&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is not the kind I want,” said Nat. “I
want some old-fashioned carpet things, with a
mouth like a catfish. You see I have lots of
things to carry with me.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to walk?” asked the storekeeper,
still more amazed. “Why, it must be as
much as one hundred and fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how far it is, I have got to go
there, unless I can find some person who is kind
enough to give me a lift.”</p>

<p>“You can do that, of course; but I was just
thinking that your legs will ache before you get
there. Now you hold on a minute. I have two
old carpet sacks in my garret that are doing no
good to anybody, and if you will wait a minute
I will bring them down to you.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>The man went to his drawer, put away the
money that Nat had given him and went out,
leaving him for the next ten minutes there alone
in the store. What a chance it would have been
for Nat to steal something; but the thought never
came into his head. He was leaning back against
the counter when the man left, and that was the
way he was standing when he came back.</p>

<p>“Those are just the things,” said he, taking
the carpet sacks and turning them over to see
that there were no holes in them. “How much
apiece for them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a quarter; or, as you were raised in this
country, two bits,” said the storekeeper, smiling
at Nat. “How do I know that you were raised in
this country? I know it by your looks. I was
raised in New York. Now do you want something
to eat? Well, come here. I don’t know
whether I have anything that dog will eat or not.
Where did you get that fellow? He would be
just the one to guard a fellow’s melon patch,
wouldn’t he? There, take your pick. It’s my
treat.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>Nat knew enough about the ways of the country
to know that the storekeeper was going to
give him his provisions for nothing because of
the dry goods he had purchased. The only things
he could find were some crackers and cheese. He
took enough of them as he thought to last him to
Manchester and back, and then the groceryman
excused himself once more and went into the back
room with a huge knife in his hand. When he
returned he brought with him a piece of fresh
meat which he handed to the dog.</p>

<p>“I did some butchering yesterday, and I
think that if that dog won’t eat anything else,
he will eat fresh meat,” said he. “See him take
it down.”</p>

<p>The dog did “take it down” and devoured
his meal as if he were almost starved. It was no
wonder that he wanted Nat for a master when he
was going to get such good living as this. He
put all the things he had purchased into one of
his valises, bade the proprietor good-by and took
his way back toward Manchester, feeling much
lighter hearted than he did when he came down.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
But he did not go very far before he began looking
up and down the road to see if anyone was
watching him; and having satisfied his mind on
this score he once more climbed the fence into
the woods, and when he was safe from everybody’s
view he stopped, and lowered his bundles
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Now when I put these things down I am
Nat, the tramp; and when I put on my other
clothes, I am something else,” said he, taking his
suit out and unfolding it before him. “Let us
see how it looks to be dressed up as a white
man.”</p>

<p>This was Nat’s object in getting so far away
from the road so that he could make a change in
his appearance. To take off the clothes he then
had on did not require a second’s time, but it took
more time than it did to put on the others. In fifteen
minutes he was all dressed, and then he
wished he had a looking glass to view himself.
He certainly did look like a different person;
and it is doubtful if any one who was acquainted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
with him had met him on the road, if he would
have recognized him. His first care was to put
what remained of his roll of bills safe in his vest
pocket. There were no holes in the vest for the
bills to work out, and when Nat tucked them away
he felt that he was somebody.</p>

<p>“Now I am Nat Wood, gentleman,” said he,
as he surveyed himself as well as he could by
turning first one leg and then the other to make
an estimate of himself. “I tell you it makes a fellow
feel grand to be dressed up as I am. Supposing
Caleb should see me now? Whoo-pe! He
would not rest easy until he got these things on
his own back.”</p>

<p>Having put away his old clothing in one of
the valises&mdash;it is true the clothes were old but
they might be of some assistance to him some day&mdash;he
took a carpet sack in each hand and kept on
his way toward Manchester. The dog did not
know hardly what to make of it. He looked at
Nat closely; for several minutes before he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
follow him, and then he seemed to think it was
all right and ran on as freely as he did before.</p>

<p>Nat did not go through Manchester; he knew
too much for that. He went ahead until he saw
the roofs of the houses, and then turned out into
the fields and took a round-about course to bring
him to the woods back of Mr. Nickerson’s yard.
He was very still about it, halting every few feet
to listen, and finally he stopped in a ravine where
he threw his bundles off again. He was now
within reach of the place where he had hidden his
money. He wanted to be sure that his fortune
was safe before he had anything to eat.</p>

<p>“Come this way, Benny; it is right out
here,” said Nat. “If that is gone I am gone;
but I don’t think there has anybody discovered
it.”</p>

<p>Nat presently stood beside the log which concealed
his treasure, but this time he was not satisfied
with what he saw on the outside. The
leaves and twigs were there as he had left them,
but that did not suit him. He looked sharply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
through the woods in all directions, then kneeled
down beside the log and with a few sweeps
cleared away all the <i>debris</i> which he had placed
there. The bags were where he had left them.
He ran his hand over them and could distinctly
feel the “yellow boys” with which they were
filled.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, it is all mine, and no one
else has a right to lay a claim to any of it,” said
Nat, as he pushed the twigs and branches back
to their place. “Mr. Nickerson gave it to me before
he died, he has neither kith nor kin to say
that he owns it, and now if I can find some honest
lawyer in St Louis to stand up for me, I am all
right.”</p>

<p>This was a matter that created considerable
confusion in Nat’s mind. He did not know where
to go to find an honest lawyer, but he supposed
that there must be some people who would look
out for him if he only knew whom to speak to.
As he had done a hundred times before he dismissed
this matter with the thought that it would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
be time enough to attend to that when he reached
St. Louis; and he turned to go back to the ravine
where to solace himself with a handful of crackers
and cheese.

<span class="medium"><i>Benny, the Tramp.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">That</span> was a long night to Nat Wood for, if
the truth must be told, he did not once
close his eyes in sleep. He had an opportunity
to judge of the watchfulness of his new
friend, for Benny seemed to be wide awake and
never once forgot that everything depended on
Nat’s vigilance. He lay close beside Nat on the
leaves, and once or twice he raised his head and
growled at something, but nothing came near to
disturb them. At the first peep of day Nat arose
from his couch, he and the dog finished what was
left of the crackers and cheese and then the boy
went to the place where he had left his treasure
and filled up his carpet sacks; and when he had
them loaded he was surprised at their weight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
It did not seem possible that he could carry that
gold one hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>“But I may strike a railroad before I have
gone far,” said Nat, drawing in a long breath and
picking up a valise in each hand. “I will go
as straight South as I can go, and when I become
tired of my burden I can put it down and
rest. I will reach St. Louis or die in the attempt.”</p>

<p>Nat took good care to keep clear of the road
until he had passed Manchester for fear that
some one would see him and recognize him in
spite of his new suit, and when at last he climbed
the fence into the highway, he drew another long
breath and went ahead with new zeal. He did
not fail to look back occasionally to see if he were
followed, but every time there was no one in
sight, and he was more than once tempted to believe
that his struggles were over; that the money
was his own, and all he had to do was to hurry
down to St. Louis and deposit it in the bank. But
it would be a week at least, and perhaps two, before
that would happen, and in the meantime he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
was resolved that he would go hungry and sleepless,
too, but that his treasure should be safe.</p>

<p>Nat wanted to buy some more crackers and
cheese and feed his dog before he left the country
where he was known, and with this object in view
he approached the store at which he had purchased
his new suit. The man was busy sweeping
out, but he knew Nat in spite of the wonderful
change in his appearance.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you got your things, didn’t
you?” said he, with the smile which Nat had noticed
on his face the day before. “You are off
now, I suppose? But you must not try to walk
all that distance. It is too far.”</p>

<p>“I am off now,” replied Nat. “But I
should like to have some more crackers and cheese
and a bite of fresh meat for Benny, if it is not
too much trouble for you to get it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can. I was thinking about you
yesterday after you had been in here, and there
is no need that you should walk all that distance.
Follow this road about twenty miles and you will
strike a little village called Bridgeport. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
you will hit the Alton road, and all you have to
do is to pay your fare and get on board. You
have money enough for that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Nat selected a couple of crackers and a liberal
piece of cheese from the amount the grocer
weighed out to him, saw his dog devour a huge
piece of beef which had also been furnished to
him, leaned against the counter to rest his tired
limbs and pondered upon a thought that had just
then occurred to him. He had never ridden on a
railroad, he did not know what to do when he got
there, but what would be done with Benny!</p>

<p>“But there is one thing about it,” said the
man, giving utterance to the thought that was
in Nat’s mind. “You can’t take your dog with
you on a passenger train.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about that, and the
best thing I can do is to go on foot all the way,”
said Nat. “I can’t think of leaving Benny behind.”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t know what rules they
have with their freight trains,” said the man.
“Perhaps they will let you take him with you,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
and perhaps they won’t. You can tell when you
get to Bridgeport. Good-by. I hope you will get
safe through.”</p>

<p>Nat picked up his valises again and left the
store. It seemed now that Benny was a hindrance
to him rather than a success, and for a
minute or two he did not know but he would prefer
to give him up than keep him. It did not
seem possible that he could walk all the way to
St Louis and carry his treasure besides, and he
looked down at Benny who gazed back at him,
and wagged his tail in a forlorn sort of way as
if the man had given him a bad reputation.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do it Benny,” said Nat, putting
one of his valises on the ground long enough
to pat the dog on the head. “I’ll keep you with
me until the time comes for you to show what you
are made of; then if you fail me, I will know
what to do with you.”</p>

<p>Perhaps, when Nat came to think about it, it
was better after all to keep the dog and trust to
luck. There were plenty of persons who met him
on the road who would have been glad to snatch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
his valises and make off with them, if they only
knew how much was in them; and with Benny
there to protect him he did not think they would
attempt it. So Benny was accepted on sufferance.</p>

<p>Nat had not proceeded very far on his road
before he heard the sound of wheels behind him,
and in a few minutes a man drove by in a lumber
wagon. The man looked down at Nat and then
pulled up his team.</p>

<p>“Soger, would you work?” said he, with a
laugh. “You have a heavy load there. Are you
going fur?”</p>

<p>“I am going down to Bridgeport,” said Nat.
“If you have a place for me I shall be glad to
get in.”</p>

<p>“You are as welcome as the flowers in May,”
said the man. “Climb in. Gosh! What an ugly
looking dog you have. Will he bite?”</p>

<p>“He has never bitten anybody since I had
him,” said Nat, lifting his carpet sacks one after
the other and putting them into the wagon with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
good deal of trouble. “He won’t bite if he is let
alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, you just bet your bottom dollar that
I won’t interfere with him. What you got in
there? It seems mighty heavy.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is some tools that I work with. Do
you know anybody in Bridgeport?”</p>

<p>This question got the man off on a new subject,
and during the ride to Bridgeport, and he
went all the way so that Nat had his arms well
rested by the time they got there, he never referred
to the contents of the valises again. Benny
ran along the wagon in front of him, and every
time the man saw him he would remark on his
savage appearance, and say that he did not see
what a man could be thinking of to have such an
ill-looking brute hanging around him. The man
had been in the Confederate army, too, and during
the ride he kept Nat interested in his exploits,
until Nat was really surprised when he pointed
to the roofs of some houses in the distance and
said:</p>

<p>“We are near our journey’s end at last.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
There is Bridgeport Did you say that you wanted
to get out at the depot? Well, I am going right
there.”</p>

<p>After a few cracks with the whip and turning
several corners the man drew up at a long,
low building, and Nat, after thanking him for his
kindness, took his valises and got out. Presently
he was standing in front of an open window, on
the other side of which, on a high stool, was
perched a clerk who was busy smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, what can I do for you on
this fine morning?” was the way he greeted Nat.</p>

<p>“I want to know what is the fare to St
Louis,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Eight seventy-five,” said the clerk, laying
down his cigar and reaching for a ticket “Do
you want to go there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I want to know in the first
place whether or not you will take my dog on a
passenger train,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Where’s the dog?”</p>

<p>“He is right here.”</p>

<p>“Hold him up so that I can see him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>“I can’t. He is too heavy.”</p>

<p>The clerk reached for his cigar again, got
down from his stool and unlocked the door leading
into his room. He came out of it, but He went
back in less time than it takes to tell it.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! Do you want to take that
beast on the train?” said he. He vanished in his
room on the instant and closed the door, all except
a little opening through which he talked to Nat.
“No, <i>sir</i>. There is not a baggage-smasher on the
road who will take charge of that dog between
here and St. Louis. You must be crazy.”</p>

<p>“Well, would they take him on a freight
train?”</p>

<p>“<i>Cer</i>-tainly not. We want to have some
men to handle the freight train when they get to
St. Louis, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you do; but what is the reason
you can’t have them any way?”</p>

<p>“Why, that dog will eat the train men all
up, if he once gets in action. No, sir. You can’t
take that beast on any train on this road.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see any way but for me to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
on foot,” said Nat, who was very much disappointed.</p>

<p>“That’s the only way that I know of, unless
you will kill the dog.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do that, you bet. Does this road go
straight to St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“As straight as a die, and that’s the way,”
said the clerk, pointing out the direction. “I
don’t see what you want with that thing. The
best thing you can do is to kill him.”</p>

<p>Nat picked up his valises, walked slowly out
of the other side of the depot and looked down
the track. For miles it was perfectly straight,
and there was not another house within sight.
His arms ached awfully when he thought of the
many miles of such track he would have to face
during his tramp, but he never once was guilty
of a traitorous thought to Benny. They were in
for it, and the sooner they started in on it, the
sooner it would be done.</p>

<p>“Now the first thing to be done, Benny, is
to lay in a lot of provisions,” said Nat, as if the
dog could understand every word he said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
“And the next thing is to start on our way. Let
us go down this way and see what we can find.”</p>

<p>Nat had set out with the intention of finding
a grocery store and a butcher shop at which to
purchase his provisions, but he had not made
many steps before he found one much sooner
than he had expected; or rather, some thing who
kept guard over it saw him coming down the
street and sprang to meet him half way. It was
the big dog which kept watch over the butcher
stand. He saw Benny, he did not like the looks
of him and proceeded to let him know it in language
that anybody could understand. He
came at full speed down the road, seize Benny
by the neck and rolled him over in the gutter.
They were both fair sized dogs, and those who
saw the movement were pretty certain that they
were about to witness a good fight; but it was all
over in less than two seconds, Benny seemed
surprised to find himself in the gutter, turned
his head to see who it was that had dared to
molest him and went to work in earnest to put a
stop to it. He seized his assailant by the foreleg,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
but before he had taken a fairly good hold
the butcher’s dog set up a fearful howl, slunk
out of the fight as quickly as he could and limping
on three legs, howling at every jump, he
went back to his place in the butcher’s shop. A
moment later the butcher appeared. Nat knew
that it was the butcher, for his coat was off, he
had his apron on and his sleeves were rolled up.</p>

<p>“Now, Benny, you have got me into a terrible
scrape,” said Nat, reaching down to give
the dog a reassuring pat. “He will want to kill
you, but he will have to kill me first.”</p>

<p>The butcher seemed to be surprised to find
that his favorite had been whipped, but still he
did not show it. He examined his dog and then
looked up to see what had caused it; and when he
saw Nat approaching he grinned all over.</p>

<p>“Young man, is that your dog?” said he.</p>

<p>Nat replied that it was.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he is a nobby fellow,” said the
butcher; and giving no heed to Benny’s savage
looks he caught him by the upper jaw and raised
his lips so that he could see his teeth. Then he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
released his hold upon him and patted him on
the side so loudly that you could have heard it
across the street. “I have said that I would
give twenty-five dollars for any dog that could
whip Barney, and this dog has done it with just
one grip. You will take that for him, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Nat. “The dog is not
for sale.”</p>

<p>“Then I will give you twenty plus ten, which
makes thirty when I went to school. Come in
and get it.”</p>

<p>“That is more than the dog is worth, but he
is not for sale at any price. I need the dog more
than you do. But I will tell you what I would
like to have. He wants a piece of meat.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t sell the dog, come in
and fill him up on meat You wouldn’t look at
forty dollars for that dog, would you?”</p>

<p>No, Nat thought that he would not sell the
dog, and he went into the butcher shop and got
a piece of meat that fairly made him open his
eyes. He was not charged a cent for it, either.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
While the butcher was examining the dog and
complimenting him, Nat managed to unclose one
of his valises and crowd the meat into it, and no
one was the wiser for what he had done.</p>

<p>Of course the victory that Benny had won
brought him into notice along the street, and
when he went into another store to buy his crackers
and cheese, he had plenty of friends to
admire him. But Nat got away as soon as he
could, and felt much easier when he was walking
down the track toward St. Louis.</p>

<p>“That’s a good name for you, Benny, and
you will keep it as long as I have anything to do
with you. Benny, the tramp. That’s what you
are, Benny, and you must always come when I
call you.”</p>

<p>Nat’s first care was to find a place where he
could sit down and satisfy his appetite without
having some one to talk to him about Benny. A
mile further on he found it, and there he and
Benny made away with enough meat and crackers
and cheese to last them until night. While
there a passenger train went along, and it went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
swiftly, too, as if the distance that lay between
it and St. Louis was just nothing at all for it to
accomplish. Nat sighed but he looked at Benny,
and got up and followed after the train.</p>

<p>We might make this portion of our story
still more interesting by telling of the wonderful
scrapes that Nat and his money got into from the
rough looking tramps who met him along the way
and who wanted to know what was in his carpet-sacks,
which he never allowed out of his grasp;
but unfortunately Nat did not meet with any
such adventures. It is true that one or two
tramps&mdash;Nat was sure they were tramps
although he had never seen one before&mdash;made
some inquiries in regard to the contents of his
valises, but the sight of the dog, which growled
and showed his teeth every time one of them
came up, induced them to be satisfied with what
Nat had to say about it&mdash;that he had some tools
which would be necessary to carry on his business
when he got to St. Louis. He bought his
food from farm houses which were scattered at
intervals along the railroad, slept beside the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
fence or in deserted barns every time he got the
chance, and finally, when he was thinking about
taking one of his gold pieces to buy him another
pair of shoes, for his bills, although he had held
on to them “until the eagle hollered,” were all
gone, he discovered, one night when the sun was
about two hours high, some buildings in the distance,
which were larger than any he had seen
yet. By cautious inquiries at the next house at
which he stopped to buy food, he learned that he
was at his journey’s end. How his heart thrilled
with the thought! He had been more than two
weeks on the way, and to say that he was tired
would be hardly saying enough. In a few days
his money would be safe, and then he could lie
down and sleep.</p>

<p>“But our labor is not over yet,” said Nat,
as he separated the meat from the sandwiches
that he had purchased and handed it to the dog.
“Now is the time to look out for every person
we meet. There is not one of them who would
not knock me on the head to gain this money.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
And yet I am to find a good, honest lawyer in all
this crowd of people!”</p>

<p>Nat did not know how he was going to succeed,
whether or not he could find what he
wanted in all that crowd, but he resolved to try
it at the first opportunity. Arriving at a place
where a road ran across the track he turned into
it, making out with much difficulty some of the
signs that graced the front ends of buildings as
he walked along, and finally stopped at the front
of a more pretentious building than the rest, for
there was a sign that struck his eye; “Lodgings
50 cents.”</p>

<p>Nat pushed the door open and he and Benny
walked in. He did not like the appearance of
the room in which he found himself, but then he
supposed that all hotels in the city looked like
that. There was a bar in one corner of it, behind
which stood a man that reminded him of Jonas
Keeler as far as his appearance was concerned.
On the other side of the room were tables in front
of which were men playing cards, and others
with men sprawling out upon them with their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
heads pillowed upon their arms as if fast asleep.
He thought of backing out and trying it again at
another place; but the man behind the bar discovered
him and came out.</p>

<p>“Ah! Here you are. You want a supper
and some lodging, I suppose? Are you traveling
far? Hello? Where did you get that dog?
Will he bite?”</p>

<p>“He has been with me a long time, and I
never saw him bite anybody yet. He always
sleeps with me and he won’t let any one harm me.
I want a bed but I don’t want any supper.”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth! What’s in your
grip?” said the man lifting one from the floor
where Nat had placed it.</p>

<p>“They are tools I work with; hammers and
the like.”</p>

<p>“Oh. You are a machinist, are you? Well,
come along and I will show you to your room.
I hope that dog won’t nail me until I get down.”</p>

<p>The man stepped behind the bar to obtain
a key to Nat’s room, and carrying the carpet-sack
in one hand while Nat followed with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
other, they went through the room and up the
stairs to Nat’s apartment.</p>

<p>“There, sir, you can lock yourself in and
be safe until morning. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Nat was too tired to look around his room
and see what sort of a place it was. He turned
down the quilts with the remark that the sheets
might have been cleaner, pulled off his clothes,
and tumbled into bed; and he had hardly struck
the pillow before he was sound asleep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="medium"><i>Conclusion.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> was one little thing that troubled
Nat, and it came to him the first thing
when he opened his eyes in the morning.
His bills were all gone, and he must unlock one of
his valises, undo one of his bags and take out
gold enough to pay the proprietor for his lodgings.
There was not anything so very wrong
in that, but suppose the proprietor should become
suspicious and ask to see the rest of his
valise; and suppose, too, that he should take it
away from him?</p>

<p>“It has got to be done, and I might as well
have it over with,” said Nat, throwing aside the
quilts and jumping out on the floor. “You will
stand by me, Benny, won’t you?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>Nat went to his valise and opened it, and was
surprised to find that one of the bags was decayed
and its contents had ran out. But the
carpet sack had caught them and there was none
of them missing. He took up a ten dollar gold
piece and put it in his pocket; and then went on
with his dressing with all possible speed. It was
early yet and he hoped to find no one in the bar
except the proprietor. He did not want any
breakfast, either. It would be time enough to
think about that after he had seen his money
safe. The proprietor was alone in the room, engaged
in washing up, but he greeted Nat with a
hearty good morning.</p>

<p>“I want to pay for my lodging,” said Nat.
“My bills are all gone and so I will have to
hand you that.”</p>

<p>“W-h-e-w!” exclaimed the man, as Nat laid
his piece on the counter. “You must have been
living with some rich people since you were
here.”</p>

<p>The man took up the ten dollar gold piece,
jingled it upon the counter to see if it was all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
right, then turned to his drawer to get the money
that he was to give Nat in change.</p>

<p>“Breakfast will be ready in a little while,
lad, you had better wait,” said he, at length.</p>

<p>Nat made some excuse, he hardly knew what,
took up both his valises and left the room to run
into the arms of a policeman before he got to
the sidewalk. He knew it was a policeman, because
he had a badge on his breast, was dressed
in uniform and was swinging his club along as
if waiting for a chance to use it on somebody.
The police were always ready to assist a friendless
person, and Nat was certain that this one would
assist him. He walked up to him and put his
valises down by his side.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what have you got there?” said
he; and Nat was delighted to see him smile in a
friendly sort of way.</p>

<p>“It is money,” said Nat, sinking his voice.</p>

<p>“Money?” said the officer, more than half
inclined to believe that the boy was crazy.
“What are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I want to get it into the bank where it will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
be safe,” said Nat. “You don’t believe it, do
you? Well, step here and I will show you.”</p>

<p>Nat drew off on one side and the policeman,
placing his club behind him, strolled slowly after
him. He saw Nat unlock the valise with a
smile, but when the contents of it were shown to
him the smile gave away to a look of profound
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Where did you get all this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In the ground. Have you got a hotel or
any place you stop at when you are asleep?”</p>

<p>“Hotel? No. We have a police court, if that
is what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you got any lawyers there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; there are plenty of them there.”</p>

<p>“I want to find a good, honest lawyer who
will take charge of this money and tell me what
to do with it. You see I am a stranger here.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw that.”</p>

<p>“Now can I find such a one up there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course you can, and it is the very
place for you to go. I will show you where it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
is. I will carry one of your carpet sacks and
you can carry the other.”</p>

<p>There were more people stirring now than
there were when Nat came out of his hotel, and
nearly all who passed him on the street turned
too look at him with astonishment and others
with amusement. They thought that Nat was
being arrested for something he had done; but
those who looked at his innocent face as he walked
along talking to the policeman, knew better
than that.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to be where I can tell the truth
regarding this money,” said Nat; and the long-drawn
sigh that he uttered gave evidence to his
words.</p>

<p>“What did you tell folks you had?” asked
the officer.</p>

<p>“I told them that I had tools which I needed
to work with when I reached St Louis,” said
Nat. “And they thought I was a machinist, and
did not ask any more questions. But I will tell
you what is a fact: The presence of that dog
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
has saved me from being robbed more than
once.”</p>

<p>The policeman said he was sure of that, and
at last turned to the right and led Nat up a flight
of stone steps and into the court room. There
were plenty of police officers standing around,
but they all made room for them to pass and
looked at Nat with some curiosity. The room in
which the trials were held was arranged
with benches and chairs, and around the outside
were more chairs and to these he conducted Nat
and set him down in front of a window.</p>

<p>“Now you keep still right here, and when
the judge comes you can talk to him,” said he.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know the judge when I see
him,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“I will speak to one of those policemen there
and he will tell him. I must go now.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you stay with me?”</p>

<p>“Because I must go on my beat. If anybody
talks to you about your money, you can say
what you please. There’s men enough here to
protect you. So long.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>There was a good deal of this talk that Nat
could not understand, but he asked no questions.
Everybody could see that he was a stranger there
and to the city besides, and all he wanted to
know now was where to go to place his money
so that it would be safe. He looked at the
policemen, but they did not seem to have anything
to do but just to stand around and wait for
somebody. They were tall, broad-shouldered
fellows, and he was certain that Jonas, if he
could have found his way into that court room,
would think twice before laying claim to any of
Nat’s money. When he grew tired of looking at
them he turned and looked out of the window.
The people seemed to have increased in numbers,
and it was a mystery where they all came from.
He thought he would never get weary of looking
at them, and when he turned to look at the policemen
again, he found that the court room was
filled; but no one paid any attention to him. A
few looked at the dog, others cast glances toward
the carpet-sacks, and Nat finally wondered what
had become of the police justice all this time;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
but while he was turning the matter over in his
mind the crowd in front of the door gave way,
and two gentlemen who seemed to have a right
there, came in. They exchanged greetings with
those they met, and presently one of them was
stopped by a policeman, who seemed to be communicating
something to him. Nat was certain
that one of them was talking about him, for they
nodded their heads in his direction, and finally
the two men came toward the corner where he
was sitting.</p>

<p>“Do you want to see me, young man?” one
of them inquired.</p>

<p>“I want to see the judge when he comes,”
replied Nat. “I want to find a good, honest lawyer
to tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the man. “You want
to find a good, <i>honest</i> lawyer, do you? Well, you
have come to a bad shop to find him. How do
you think Judge Daniels will suit you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the man, for I am a stranger
in a strange place; but I will talk to any man
whom you recommend.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>“Daniels, I guess you are in for it,” said the
man, turning to his companion. “This is Judge
Daniels, and you may tell him what you want.”</p>

<p>The speaker turned away and Nat proceeded
to give the man who had been called Judge Daniels
a good looking over. All he saw was the
man’s face. It was a benevolent looking face,
and more than all there was a smile upon it which
instantly won Nat’s heart.</p>

<p>“What do you want to say to me?” was the
way in which he began the conversation.</p>

<p>“I have a long story to tell, and you will
have to sit down beside me while I tell it,” said
Nat. “In the first place, you will not steal every
thing I have got will you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I shall do that,” said the
man, as he seated himself in one of the chairs
alongside of Nat. “There is no necessity for
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it is money that I have in
these two carpet-sacks,” said Nat, sinking his
voice to a whisper. “I have dug it out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
ground, and carried it all the way from Bridgeport
on foot.”</p>

<p>The man continued to regard him with a
smile until Nat unlocked his valise; and then he
looked surprised. He listened while Nat told
his story never once interrupting him, but he kept
his eyes fastened upon the boy as if he meant to
look him through.</p>

<p>“You want in the first place, to put that
money in the bank where it will be safe,” said
he, at length. “Then are you willing to go back
with me to Bridgeport so that I can collect evidence
that your story is true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I will go with you anywhere,”
said Nat.</p>

<p>This was all that Judge Daniels wanted.
He had been doing a heap of thinking while Nat
was telling his story, and when he had seen Nat
close his valise he got up and walked over to
where the police justice sat in his chair. The
court was just about ready to begin. He was
evidently astonished at what the judge had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
tell him, and when he came back he was full of
business.</p>

<p>“I will carry one valise, you can carry the
other, and we will go down, get a carriage and
take them to the bank,” said he. “That will be
the first job done. I hope the dog will not bite
me?”</p>

<p>Nat hastened to assure him that the dog
would not, and together they left the court room
and in a few moments more were seated in a
hack, with Benny for company, and were being
whirled away toward the bank in the lower end
of the city. At every turn Nat found something
to wonder at. The streets were crowded with all
sorts of vehicles and Nat more than once held
his breath for fear that their driver would run
into some of them.</p>

<p>Pedestrians crossed and recrossed before
them until Nat was certain that somebody would
be run down; but he did not have time to take
it all in. Judge Daniels had a good many questions
to ask, and while Nat was trying to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
everything clear to him, they drew up in front of
the bank.</p>

<p>Judge Daniels was so well known there that
he was invited at once into the private office
where there was no one to see them but the president.
At his request Nat related his story once
more, the judge watching it closely to detect
any flaws in it, and when the money was poured
out on the table before the president, the latter
could scarcely restrain his astonishment. Several
clerks were summoned to count the money,
and Nat strange as it may seem, did not bother
his head whether they counted it right or not.
The money was out of his hands, it had been surrendered
to those whose duty it was to look after
it, and he was satisfied. Finally one of the clerks
presented a paper to the president, who looked
at it and said:</p>

<p>“Do you know how much money you have
here, Bub?”</p>

<p>Nat replied that he did not. He took the
money as he found it without stopping to count
it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think you could have counted all
this money in a hurry,” said the president, with
a smile. “You have here $40,000 lacking $10.
Now what are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p>Nat was obliged to confess that he did not
know. Judge Daniels and the president exchanged
a few words in a lower tone, and then
the latter arose and picked up his hat.</p>

<p>“We’ll let it lay here until we go up to that
place of yours,” said he. “Now, Nat, you want
some good clothes. Look at your shoes. They
are all giving out.”</p>

<p>How different this was from what Jonas
said to him the last time he referred to Nat’s
shoes! He readily surrendered himself to Judge
Daniels’ guidance, and in half an hour more
came out of the tailor shop with a wonderful
change in his appearance. The clothes he had
taken off would do very well for the country but
they would hardly do for the city. It was not
possible that anybody who had known him in
Manchester could have recognized him. Then
after he had been to a barber shop and had his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
hair neatly trimmed, the transformation was complete.</p>

<p>The next thing was to go to Judge Daniels’
home and get dinner; and here Nat’s admiration
and surprise knew no bounds. It did not seem
that those chairs were made to sit on, or that the
carpet was made to walk on; or that the lady who
came to see him, would not take wings and fly up
out of his sight. It was the judge’s wife. She
seated herself beside him on the sofa, listening
in unbounded astonishment to Nat’s story, the
Judge watching it all the time to see if there were
any flaws in it, and when it was over she reached
down and patted the dog, and Benny never raised
any objections to it.</p>

<p>During the afternoon they went down to the
Judge’s office where there was another consultation
held between him and his partner. The
latter was amazed, but he thought that the best
thing the Judge could do would be to accompany
Nat to his home and get all the evidence there
was to be had; so the next morning, Benny being
left with the hostler, they took the cars
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
for Bridgeport. This was the first time that Nat
had been on a railroad train, and sometimes,
when he looked out at the window and saw how
fast they were going, he could not help clutching
the seat for fear that the train was going to leave
the track. Arriving at Bridgeport they went to
a hotel for the rest of the night, and the next
morning they hired a carriage to take them to
Pond Post Office. We can scarcely imagine
what Nat’s feelings were when he gazed upon
the scenes which were so familiar to him; and
when at last he got out of the carriage and opened
the bars so that it could be driven through to
where Jonas was standing in the door waiting for
them, he felt like yelling. On the contrary he
controlled himself and said quietly:</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Keeler?”</p>

<p>“Well, I will be dog-gone!” was all Jonas
had to say in reply.</p>

<p>Getting the evidence he was in search of was
not difficult. Jonas saw in a moment “which
side of his bread had the butter onto it,” and
answered all his questions readily; while the antics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
which Caleb went through were enough to
make Nat fairly burst with merriment. They
were all sincere, too. He said “dog-gone the
luck” several times in a whisper, felt of Nat’s
clothing with his fingers, and could not bring
himself to believe that the thing was true. But
it was to Mrs. Keeler that Nat devoted the most
of his attention. The woman seemed really glad
of his good luck, and Nat assured her that at
some future time there was a thousand dollars
awaiting for her out of Mr. Nickerson’s money.</p>

<p>It was a happy moment for Nat when they
seated themselves in the carriage bound for
Bridgeport, and Judge Daniels declared that, as
far as he could see, Nat’s story was all true, and
that the money which he had struggled so hard
to obtain was all his. All that remained to do
now was to have a guardian appointed and get
ready to go to school.</p>

<p>“It will not take me five minutes to select a
guardian,” said Nat. “Will you take it Judge
Daniels?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>The judge said he would and so the matter
was settled.</p>

<p>Years have passed away since the events
that are recorded in this story took place, and if
you go to a certain law firm and ask to see
Nathaniel Wood, you would be fairly surprised
to see in that tall, well-dressed man who is coming
toward you the ragged, dirty-faced boy who
was wont to do the chores about Jonas Keeler’s
place. Jonas thinks the world of him, although
to tell the truth, he does not do any work to
speak of as long as his remittance from St. Louis
lasts.</p>

<p>“Do you know Nat Wood, that little snipe
who used to work on my farm?” he would say to
some listener. “Well, he has got to be a big lawyer
in the city. If he ever runs for President, I
am going to vote for him.”</p>

<p>Benny is dead; he served his day and generation
faithfully. He soon grew to be a regular
favorite around the Judge’s house, and although
a tramp would have passed by on the other side,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
people who came there on business were readily
admitted, and no questions asked. Nat is the
same fellow he always was. He was an honest
boy and he grew up to be an honest man. He is
always ready to live over old times; but those he
likes best to talk about are those that attended his
Struggle for a Fortune.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
